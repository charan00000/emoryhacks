"Hi my daughter has been in hospital for two weeks with abdominal pain which goes through to her back and is painful when her tummy is pressed and her back. She had her appendix removed 7 weeks ago in Turkey as they had ruptured and the poison affected her blood. She is having trouble urinating she can go but it takes her a long time, has been feeling nauseous and today started vomiting . The doctors yesterday started treating for pid with oral antibiotics but they are not sure that is the cause. She has had an ultrasound abdominal and a ct of her tummy and all looks fine. The pain is getting more severe and she has gone from feeling sick to vomiting and the pain is no better even though she is taking paracetamol , codeine , ibuprofen and oramoph and also anti sickness tablets. Her bloods are showing up clear, although one was slightly, but only slightly they say, for infection which they think could be left over from the appendix op. A small amount of fluid was seen on the ultrasound that shouldn t be there but ultrasound was carried out last Monday and CT last Wednesday. She has had an internal examination and that was extremely painful.","Dear Tina, I don't know the most important thing; how old is you daughter?  Symptoms you're describing can be related to appendectomy complication especially if it was perforated and pelvic type of appendicitis. It seems like ureter was irritated which is a common complication and urinary infection should be ruled out definitely. Abscesses collection after appendectomy which US is describing could cause such symptoms, and it must be treated by antibiotics. Percutaneous puncture of collection can be also done if necessary but I suggest just to wait for the effect of antibiotics. If fertility and pain persist then u should repeat CT scan. Also, I think that you shouldn't give analgesics to child because it can hide symptoms, be care about it...you must know the intensity of pain no matter how it hurts because it guides doctor to the right diagnosis. Wish you good health, Chat Doctor. "
Thank you so much for the education :),"Did you place the back of the watch on your chest (in the V2 lead position) and then touch the crown with your finger to get this? If so, then the inverted T wave you are concerned about would not be a valid finding. The voltages in the precordial (V) leads in a 12 lead EKG are measured in relation to the average of the 4 limb leads, not just one arm which the watch is doing. EKG tracings from Apple Watches are good for determining heart rhythms but not much else."
That doesnt sound good.,"Yes, this partThey said there were nodes in his lungs, but that they werent treating and just want to keep an eye on until mid December, then talk about what to do if they grow. The problem is, he is weak and is having trouble breathing.doesn't sound good at all. Sounds like his metastases are growing pretty fast when he's already noticing bulging from lymph nodes and trouble breathing from lung metastases. But we don't really have enough information to make this determination right now. Missing information:The exact histopathology (is it clear cell renal cell carcinoma or something more exotic?)Imaging reportsThe date of imaging and surgery to get a feeling for the timeline and progression dynamicsWhy his treating physicians said that ""his body encapsulated the tumor"" when they also said he has lung metastases, and why they didn't indicate systemic therapy and why they seemed to think his prognosis is good.Taking the most likely case based on incomplete information: In metastatic classic clear cell renal cell carcinoma, no chemotherapy is indicated ever, because chemotherapeutic agents don't help, which has been tried and demonstrated over and over. Effective medications are immunotherapy (checkpoint inhibitor antibodies like pembrolizumab), TKIs (tyrosin kinase inhibitors that can be taken orally, like sunitinib, pazopanib, cabozantinib or axitinib) and as probably less effective alternatives medications that inhibit vascular growth (e.g. bevacizumab or lenvatinib) or mTOR-inhibitors (e.g. temsirolimus).What's indicated precipitates on your husband's other medications, comorbidities, performance status (overall health) and other stuff.Also, in oligometastatic renal cell carcinoma, locally ablative therapies can be used to kill all the metastases you can detect at the moment, for example radiosurgery, microwave ablation etc., but your husband's case doesn't sound like that from the very limited information we got.Edit: As \/u\/Porencephaly already wrote, your next step is to contact his oncologist's office. They need to determine what the problem is right now (maybe it's even an infection and not metastatic progression) probably with new CT imaging and formulate a plan of action.His trouble breathing could be due to anemia, or a number of infections, or heart problems, or lymph node metastases compressing blood vessels or a bronchus, or pleural effusion, or whatever else... this is all more probable than trouble breathing due to lung metastases themselves, which surpisingly rarely are symptomatic in this way."

"Hi, my baby is 6 months old. he got cold and cough since Tuesday. I referred a doctor on Wednesday who suggested to go for nubilization. I continued nubilization for 3 days that is Wednesday, Thursday and Friday but no improvement. today I went back again and doctor said that it looks like bronchitis infection and suggested Respinil syrup and wikoryl AF drops and nubilization with budecort and asthalin. is the good medication and can there be chance of further issues. And is nubilization important, can it lead to asthma etc in future","Hello mam, you have not mentioned if your baby has had fever ? If yes then please get his counts, CBC and a chest X-ray done.

Your hyperparathyroidism is possibly the most crucial thing to get under control. Chronic hypercalcemia obviously predisposes to stones, but also to a disease called nephrocalcinosis which can be painless but sometimes causes marked pain as small rocks of calcium get lodged in the draining portion of the kidney.The other not mutually exclusive possibility is you are having ureteral spasms, which are associated with hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia but no stones.So it is crucial to get your hyperparathyroidism under control. Even with ""normal"" calcium this can cause kidney problems and with hypercalcemia can cause kidney failure. If this is already under control then possibly it will get better once the ongoing calcium deposition improves. Dietary changes can also decrease calcium deposition, your nephrologist can advise on these.There are several medications available that are somewhat helpful for ureteral spasms including oxybutynin and tamsulosin but would focus on the underlying cause."
"Hello doctor, I stopped smoking 6 months ago, since then I have not visited the club till 2weeks ago when I went twice and stayed for hours in an airtight place covered with smoke, after then I started feeling sick, firstly I had stuffy nose and blocked nose to fever, now I can t breathe properly, I m still awake cos I find it difficult to breathe and can t sleep, what can I do.","Hi welcome to Chat Doctor Dear solution is the main cause of falling sick and difficulty in breathing . By now you must have realized this fact ? Adopt Exercise to Breathe Easier. Weak muscles need more oxygen, so you can become short of breath just inhaling or just moving. Exercise changes that. When your muscles are stronger, daily activities are easier.  Yoga & Panama - Deep Breathing Inhale - Hold - Exhale - Hold, for 2 seconds each , repeat 15 times. Always breath through nose. Anglo Film - close your right nostril with your thumb, inhale from left nostril, Hold for 2 seconds, Exhale from right nostril, close your left nostril with your thumb, Hold for 2 seconds and Inhale from right nostril . This Repeat 10 times.  Kapalbhatti - Exhale with slow force, only throw out your breath, all doing regularly will further strengthen your muscles.  If you haven't been active lately, check with your doctor before starting an exercise. A balanced diet which include all essential nutrients is equally important. Peanut butter can pump up your intake of both calories and protein. Protein is important at every meal for people with breathing problem. Good sources include eggs, lean meat, fish, poultry, legumes, and nuts. Crushed Garlic, ginger with honey, lemon juice with warm water with a pinch of salt and black pepper Vitamin B6 and Vitamin B12 are very important nutrients to treat asthma decreasing the inflammation in the lungs. Vitamin C Is needed to fight infection, increase the amount of oxygen and reduce inflammation. Lemon juice and AMLA are the best source of it C.

From your history, I would first suspect food allergy/allergy-like reaction. Although you already have noticed you react to chicken, the culprit food can be chicken or any of the ingredient of the preparation you consumed.Hence, I would suggest you to consult an Allergist. Two most important questions he will ask you are - 1. Have you ever had any such reaction without consuming chicken? 2. Have you ever consumed chicken and not reacted? He may also suggest you allergy testing depending upon your history. If you are allergic to chicken, I would suggest you to avoid them for at least 6 months and then try again with small amount. Hope this will be helpful to you. Wish you best of the health. Regards."

"UPDATE: [26F] recommended for termination of pregnancy in a country where I don't speak the languageOriginal post here: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskDocs\/comments\/ici7ez\/26f_recommended_for_termination_of_pregnancy_in_a\/First of all I want to say thank you, thank you, thank you not only to the physicians who responded but also to everyone who upvoted and comment-bumped me for visibility. Obviously the physician responses helped on the medical end, but the simple comment bumps helped so much emotionally. I'm in this country without family (except for my husband and toddler) and sometimes it honestly gets really lonely so having even the tiniest bit of online support meant the world to me. I even want to thank the user who posted anti-semitic comments because your comment specifically helped this hella Jewish woman connect with other Jewish women on this forum who offered hands-on support, validation, and rescoures.I had a meeting with the specialists in the termination committee today and they diagnosed the pregnancy with cystic hygroma in addition to other serious physical (nasal, respiratory, heart) malformations that would make the fetus 100% incompatible with life. They made it pretty dang clear that I could basically miscarry at any moment, which sounds about right to me as a layman given all this info. We asked about genetic testing\/probability of this happening again and they said it's very unlikely, the occurrence of this situation is less than one percent overall. So I've decided to forgo any additional testing like CVS or amniocentesis as a chromosomal defect would just be another issue on the list and not a defining factor in my choice.So unless nature takes it course, I'm scheduled for an inpatient termination this coming Monday. I can't really find anything online about inpatient terminations, but they gave me the choice and explained that the outpatient procedure would be started with dilation by osmotic dilators and move quickly while the inpatient procedure would use slow, supervised dilation with less trauma over 48 hours. I'm not 100% sure if they meant physical trauma or emotional trauma, as they mentioned some people find it very uncomfortable and impeding (especially with childcare) to do the outpatient dilation and return to the hospital for the procedure. I'd read about osmotic dilation earlier and it really freaked me out so I was super happy to have this previously unknown option offered.I'm feeling a lot more secure after hearing from everyone in this community, my doctor, and today's specialists. I never in a million years thought I'd be terminating a wanted pregnancy for any reason but I still have thousands and thousands of chances to have another baby just waiting in my ovaries so I'm going to focus on that and also on my toddler who is already my whole world. And I'm thankful in that I've experienced this and can hopefully help women who are in this situation in the future. Thanks everybody!*Edit just to add that all the doctors and social workers on the committee and at the hospital we went to spoke near perfect English which was a great relief for me and we did not have to spend money we don't have on an interpreter.*Later edit to update that the genetic blood test came back early and indicated 1:5 for down syndrome and trisomy 18.","I'm glad you got the answers you needed.Regarding the inpatient termination if you are wanting clarification I think it would be which route are you going:will you receive osmotic and\/or chemical dilators and then go on to have an evacuation procedure?will you receive osmotic and\/or chemical dilators and then go on to have an induced delivery? Just an fyi with this, people not infrequently require manual removal of the placenta, so they end up having the 'evacuation' portion anyhow (but it would just be the placenta).Both are safe. Some ""feel better"" about the second option because they feel like they are just inducing labor rather than actually ""terminating"". Fetuses in general, but especially a compromised one, have high rates of passing before delivery anyhow though.Also, you could choose to have genetic testing of any remains (and not do CVS or amniocentesis). But it is one of those things where it's optional and it may not truly change anything for you. This being said, many people like having a more solid answer.Good luck with everything. You have very good odds of having normal babies in the future."
"Hi, I am 29, married guy with two daughter. I am a social smoker. Since kids i always has sinus problem. I will easily sneeze especially in the morning. But for the past half years, i found out my sneeze has strong smell, it like blood smell. After i sneeze, the room full the smell and my family member cant stand on it. Yesterday when i sneeze hardly, i saw some blood clot come together with the mucus . I am worry..

Hi i am 40YEar old i feel to much pain in stomuch continue from one month the pain is horribe include back pain feeling hot constipation i have same pain before 5 month i did ct scan and barium found normal pain gone again pain i am worried my nature is very suspecius even if if i feel smal pain i think like i have cancer tel me what to do in 5 month i cant have deases or should i do scan remember i am indian origin i eaten spice food in my previous life,"Hi. Thanks for your history. Is the pain all over abdomen or upper abdomen only? Does it increase on eating? What are the aggravating or relieving factors? How are the stools - black? Loose, sticky? All the associated symptoms would have helped me to get a diagnosis. From available history this looks more of due to gastritis or pancreatitis. I would advise you to undergo an Endoscopy for the stomach and colon; ultrasonography to start with and confirmatory CT scan. Till you get a diagnosis I would advise you the following : Go for a proper diet and medicines-you will be fine:::*Soft bland diet without oil and spices.*Sanitizing 150 twice daily.*Risperidone thrice daily.*Antacid gel 3 tea-spoon-full every 3 hours, the first dose on getting up. If you do not get relief within 1 week - go for upper GI Endoscopy and a consultation with Gastroenterologist."
My husband has constant pain in his hands as well as finger joint pain. We are trying to figure out what could be causing it. It happens multiple times per week. Tests have shown no arthritis upon blood work. No change after stopping pravastatin for two weeks.,"Hello, Is the pain he feels radiating, tingling, numbing? Is your husband diabetic or have any signs of high blood pressure? What is his job profile? Is he having job-related to more usage of wrist and finger? If the RA factor has turned negative in the reports that it is a big relief that one of the differential diagnosis has turned out negative. What is my provisional impression to the history is there can be two possible factors which need a thorough examination. One either this could be a repetitive stress injury or two it could be nerve entrapment.  But as I said this is just my provisional impression and without having a thorough examination of the job profile and more details about the history I cannot conclude it which can make you panic. What I would suggest it please check these two things online or consult a doctor and see if either of one fits into the category if not then we have to re-examine the history and restart the process of diagnosis. On time being with related to treatment part, I would say try dipping hand in hot water and do wrist and finger movements. You can even use a sponge ball inside the hot water and perform squeezing activity. This should help to a good extent to control the pain symptoms until we come to a precise diagnosis.

Did she have some other symptoms such as diarrhea or vomiting? There are many causes of abdominal pain at this age, but the most common are abdominal cramps, gastroenteritis, appendicitis, gastritis, intussusception, food allergies, pyelonephritis, Gynecological, Referred pain.

hi my partner has been feeling unwell so he got bloods taken and was sent for an x ray his bloods said his blood count was low so he has a bleed somewhere  and his liver was inflammed or enlarged his x ray said he had a shadow at the bottom of both lungs he never smoked he does road mainteance,"Hi dear Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor. By low blood count do they mean low Hemoglobin?! Enlarged liver can be caused by many reasons that cant be counted here, but mainly due to Hepatitis Infection (A, B,C or E), it can also be due to Alcoholic or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, history of medication Chat Doctor.  People with liver disease develop some sort of thing known as portal hypertension which could lead to bleeding in the Gastrointestinal system mainly esophagus or stomach.  Based on your question it seems like the Doctors are still running some other tests to confirm, so please don't overthink and try to stop worrying, until the doctors give you a final diagnosis and treatment. Wish you all the best and hope your partner gets better soon."

"Buruli (mycobacterium ulcerans) is typically gotten in tropical areas by exposure to contaminated water or bites from infected aquatic type insects iirc. As nasty as these burn pits seem if it were buruli the pits aren't likely the culprit. Burning introduces things into our lungs, which is awful but would not give him this type of infection. If he were stacking the animals etc onto the pit or otherwise handling similar items, well then... bingo.","Middle East isnt tropical (right?), neither is Bairnsdale (Victoria, Australia), both of these places have Buruli ulcers...I have no idea what is going on in OP, but I know neither of my suggestions are commonly thought of in initial work up stages and Ive seen similar presentations here in Oz. And the historical regions of prevalence of a lot of things is changing.QquestionI said typically, which is accurate. I'm certainly familiar with the Australian outbreak. I recall saying bingo, which feels like agreeing to me, and I do agree. It's a definite possibility the specialists they saw didn't consider it. I suppose I muddied the water for no particularly good reason... That's fair.Can also be contracted by unpasteurized dairyIs there a special test for this?Not really, but Id imagine the requesting physician should mention it in their diagnosis list. (It makes the microbiologists go ah, well look for that by setting up these tests)Basically swabs then culture (mycobacterium grow bloody slowly, so it is an extended culture) and PCR (looks for DNA from the bacteria, quicker, but not always as useful).Thanks for the info re burns pits. I would definitely recommend infectious disease specialist\/s, being in close contact with burning, dead, decaying animals  human waste is a recipe for really weird parasites\/bacteria."

The new CT showed  IMPRESSION:Tiny sliver of hyperdensity seen in the right frontal lobe along anterior aspect of the right superior frontal sulcus concerning for focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage.Proximal Jugular Veins: Diminutive on the right, normal on the left.I also got in contact with the on call doctor since my neurosurgeon is on vacation and he said the location of hemorrhage isnt concerning.

I still have a terrible headache accompanied with nausea that doesnt seem to go away.

It doesnt flake, puss, or create any pimples. It is only on his face and it will spread all over his face. What could this be","Hi and welcome to ChatDoctorGiven that the rash is periodic, it is more in favor of an allergy. It could be atomic dermatitis, basically allergic causing rashes over the face, in the creases and also other body folds. Did he have similar complaints from a very young age? It could be an allergy which increases with weather changes, dust, exposure to sun, certain plants, animals etc. Also, certain foods like nuts, seafood, processed foods, etc. You will need to keep a track of when exactly the rashes come up and if there is a common cause each time. Allergies generally reduce as the child grows, but repeated exposure to the cause can make it recur often. Use a mild sunscreen when outside. When rashes appear, apply a demonize cream on the face for 5- 7 days till rash subsides, no longer. Use an antihistamine like HY Chat Doctor. To confirm you can consult a dermatologist and run tests to check allergy levels in blood, also skin tests for possible causes. Hope this helps."

Use it only on prescription from a doctor. Till then, you could try taking steam inhalations and warm water to Chat Doctor.  Take care"
"NAD but I understand that higher alkphos in children is considered normal because of bone growth. Could be the kiddo just had a growth spurt. Alkphos is an enzyme found in bones, liver,kidneys, digestive tract. Def talk to your pediatrician so they can ease your worries.","Those are both normal results for a patient her age. The doctor is ignoring them because your lab likely has a reference range that's for adults, not kidsThe creatinine level roughly reflects the muscle mass. Normal for kids is always low. If it's ""normal"" for a kid, I look twice and think about things.High alk phos (alkaline phosphatase) level in kids is almost invariably correlated with a low Vitamin D level. It's more typical these days to have a low Vitamin D than not, at least for kids. Maybe it's all the sunscreen plus much less non-screen time. Fewer sunburns but lower sunshine. I don't know that we have good guidelines for what to do with vitamin D levels these days, but if you wanted to pursue something, that would be it. Or give her a multivitamin with at least 400 IU of Vitamin D and consider rechecking in the spring.I'm curious, though -- we usually don't check these labs as part of routine blood work. There's the CBC or hemoglobin level, and lead, and then lipids and diabetes (but only for children at particularly high risk). Do you know what the physician was looking for, or why they were checking extra things?"

I wanna know if I can take hydrocodone and Imodium together. I believe my doctor said I could but Im just double checking. I have pain from my surgery two weeks ago so I need to take those pills but at the same time I have really bad diarrhea as well. Please let me know,"Hi and thank you so much for this query. I am so sorry to hear about this pain and diarrhea that you have reported. The reason why it is not advised to take these too Chat Doctor.  However, because you are having diarrhea, it will be okay to take Imodium to stop the frequent stools. What is the cause of this diarrhea? If it has not lasted more than 14 days and the cause has been shown to be non-infectious, I will discourage any use of Imodium for it may rather be more harmful than helpful. Remember to "

"8F, 78lbs, no medication. She was in the hospital for a long time but they discharged her. She is still in pain, please help. I attached the notes of her discharge.The patient is an 8-year-old white female with five weeks of fever, rash, arthralgias. Last month, the patient noted foot pain involving both left and right feet, as well as a blotchy pink rash on the leg that proceeded to spread to the trunk and then arms and then face during that week. The patient had low-grade fevers with temps to a max of 101. This has progressed to the week prior to admission higher fevers with T-max of 103.5. The patient has endorsed muscle pain, particularly in the right leg and arm, and PMD had seen the patient this week noted right knee and right index finger swelling. There is no noted weight change over this time period. No noted diarrhea or swollen nodes. The rash the patient described the week prior had an acute abrupt onset and 5-10 minutes later would dissipate.Rheumatology was consulted on the patient from admission. Lab studies were sent to rule-out an infectious etiology for rash. Strep culture was negative. EKG was also performed to rule-out a prolonged PR interval. EKG was within normal limits. A DNase B antibody was 547 and an ASO titer was 300. While results were elevated, the patient did no meet clinical criteria for rheumatic fever and diagnosis that was most likely entertained was systemic JIA. Further lab work included an ANA which was negative, rheumatoid factor which was negative, a CRP on admission was 8.6 mg\/dL with an ESR about 80. CK and aldolase were within normal limits. Ferritin was elevated at 663. LDH was within normal limits. CBC was reassuring with normal white counts, hemoglobin and platelets; findings nonsuggestive of leukemia. Hepatic panel within normal limits. A chest x-ray was done to rule-out mediastinal mass, and that was negative. From an infectious standpoint, Parvo, CMV, EBV were all negative. Clinically the patient was noted to have a salmon-colored transient rash that would come and go throughout the hospitalization lasting a matter of minutes. No definite arthritis on examination. Oncology was consulted given the history of arthritis and fevers. It was felt in the setting of normal cell lines in evaluating a smear, which revealed no blasts, no indication of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly and uric acid and LDH within normal limits and x-ray that was normal, they felt that further oncologic evaluation was not indicated and a bone marrow was not indicated at that time. Cardiology was also officially consulted because the patient had a 2\/6 ejection murmur on the exam. Cardiology felt the murmur was a flow murmur and evaluated the EKG, which they read as within normal limits, and decided an echo was not indicated to rule-out valvular disease in the setting of the rash and arthritis in an attempt to workup acute rheumatic fever.","Internal medicine doc here but in my differential is Adult Onset Stills Disease which can still present in children and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. The salmon colored rash lasting a few minutes is textbook for Adult Onset Stills Disease.I'm assuming she had blood cultures done at one or multiple points during her admission. Did she have a procalcitonin tested? Did she receive any antibiotics? Any steroids like solumedrol, prednisone etc? Does she still have joint pain? Does this rash show up only during febrile episodes? Any auto immune conditions in the family like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, hashimotos?"

He woke up and seems ok now but Im worried that it maybe something else wrong ie pneumonia or bronchitis. Can you please help.,"Hello, I understand your concern. I would like to know if he has any other symptoms such as fever or fast breathing? My suggestion is that you count the number of breaths he is taking in a minute (watch his chest movement up and down for a full minute). If it is more than 50/minute, I suggest you take him to a pediatrician who can listen to his chest for wheezing or other sounds. Watch for the following:1. High fever >102 F2. Fast breathing (>50 breaths per minute)3. Gasping for breath4. Poor feeding or decreased activity5. Wheezy sounds heard when he is breathing none of the above are present, it is unlikely that he has pneumonia or bronchiolitis. Nebulised a Chat Doctor. "

I was asked for some blood and urine examination. the result showed decrease in platelets counts 77000. The tests for malaria and dengue were also negative. After that the result showed platelets count of 62000, 71000 and 82000 on daily blood test basis. What is the reason of such low platelts count and why it is not increasing on fast basis.","Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, Low platelets occur due to rapid destruction of platelets or decreased production of platelets in the bone marrow. Since, the platelet counts are persistently low, you need to get a bone marrow aspiration study. A combined assessment of peripheral blood and bone marrow needs to be done to determine the cause of low platelet counts. Viral infections are common cause of low platelets, Is there history of viral infections in the past? If yes, then probably viral infection may be the cause of low platelet counts. Management will be planned after result to investigations is obtained. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor. "
"Hello, I m a 27 year old male. I am active and eat right. I felt 100% last night before bed, but when I woke up during the middle of the night, I had a high fever and full body aches. Upon waking up in the morning, I felt slightly better and took advil, which allowed me to function until about Noon. The fever turned to chills and my skin was really sensitive. This lessened as the day progressed. I felt better after taking a nap, but the fever and aches still persist. I also have a great deal of difficulty eating food in this condition. I don t feel like I m going to vomit, but I do feel queasy, even when eating light foods. I can drink water without issue, to the point where my urine is clear. A brief search based on my symptoms pointed to a viral infection or a tick bite. I have not been close to tall grass or wooded areas in at least the last month. The viral symptoms don t exactly match up either. My throat is not sore, and my sinuses are not congested.","Hello. I think you might just have a viral infection like the flu. You can go to your private GP or medical doctor, and you might have your blood extracted for your blood count. How is your urination? No problems like pain or change in color or blood? A urinary tract infection can also be a possibility even without urinary symptoms as mentioned, so a urine test can be requested."

"Hello. I am 33 and never took Apri21. I wanted to know if it s ok to take this medication when I just found out that I have gallstone. Also, since I had my son three years ago I been having problem with my period. ..heavy flow, cramps and pain, and It last for 7 days..After that I start feeling that I m ovulating and the discomfort continue until my period start again.","Hi.what is the generic name of Apri21, and is it FDA approved? Personally, I am not against but I do not recommend taking in of supplements/medications if they are not FDA approved or hasn't passed the clinical trials recommended for approval. Majority of the medications/supplements we are taking in, whether with medical indications or none, will pass through our liver for metabolism, and kidneys for clearance. This may cause problems, maybe not now, but in the future. It is best if you consult with a doctor for physical examination and clinical evaluation first. Diagnostics and management (medical and surgical) will be directed accordingly. For gallstones, definitive treatment is cholecystectomy or surgical removal of the gallbladder. It could be done laparoscopically (gold standard) or through open technique. Low fat diet is also recommended. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. "

Hi I have three tumors one behind my stomach and one beside my bowel and one in my grion my heath care team say it s better to watch things they are not benign and not malignant why do they not want to remove them why would theyleave them to see what happens over time,"Hi, Thanks for writing in. It is possible that the benign tumors you have mentioned are probably lipomas or neurofibromas. Both these tumors are soft tissue origin and not likely to become malignant if left untreated. A lipoma is a benign fat containing tumor which slips over the skin. A neurofibroma has nerve tissues and also does not change over time. Such tumors are to be removed only if there is pain or sudden enlargement in size. Should you have apprehension then you might get FNAC or biopsy to be done from one of the swelling to confirm the pathological diagnosis of the swelling? Please closely watch for similar tumors and discuss with your doctor if there is sudden pain or increase in size. Please do not worry."
Last night I got the sudden urge to rearrange my room. I later started feeling back pain but thought it d be gone by the morning. It s still there and extremely uncomfortable. I got up to use the restroom and when I stood up from the toilet it hurt my lower back a lot. Not only this but all of a sudden I got light headed and thought I had gotten up too quickly but it kept on getting worse. My vision started tks blur and I got off balanced.when I was holding on to the towel rack I couldn t stay up and I kept on swaying back and forth. And hit my head on the wall I felt like I was going to faint but managed to get out of the restroom and get to my bed. It slowly went away and when it did I noticed I was sweating and there was a ringing in my ear.

Peter","Hello, To comment first on the history with respect to medication, it is totally a physician decision based on the symptoms provided at the time of writing the prescription. So he will be the right person to give justification on why so many medications were prescribed.  Now coming to your pain part. The pain is due to inflammation of the joints. Which you might be aware of. RA is a moving pain and can lead to pain at small joints and big joints also at times. You have a take a bigger precaution and that is to keep yourself warm. Like staying in cold weather will aggravate the symptoms. So keeping yourself warm will be first line of action.  Next will be since how long you been facing this pain, and when was this RA diagnosed to you? This plays a key role in the overall guidance of the treatment plan. Regarding the medicine part please visit a rheumatologist as he will be the right person to take care of it.  Now treatment part. First thing is to keep the muscle and joint mobility to the maximum. So a physiotherapist will play a key role here. They might perform some passive or active exercise based on a physical assessment. Also, physical therapy pain reduction modalities like Ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy will be of benefit to reduce the pain.  Besides, please understand that this is only symptomatic for the pain. But to improve the metabolism and keep the body warm internally is only in your hand. The more the active you are the more, the better the outcome score. Usually, I see chronic RA cases in my clinical practice. They all respond well to exercise. Any kind of deformity present needs correction via physical therapy or with the help of splints. But most patients respond well to exercise in long term rehabilitation. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.  Jay In Chat Doctor. "

how vaccines prevent disease,"Why Are Childhood Vaccines So Important? It is always better to prevent a disease than to treat it after it occurs. Diseases that used to be common in this country and around the world, including polio, measles, diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), rubella (German measles), mumps, tetanus, rotavirus and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) can now be prevented by vaccination. Thanks to a vaccine, one of the most terrible diseases in history – smallpox – no longer exists outside the laboratory. Over the years vaccines have prevented countless cases of disease and saved millions of lives. Immunity Protects us From Disease Immunity is the body’s way of preventing disease.  Children are born with an immune system composed of cells, glands, organs, and fluids located throughout the body. The immune system recognizes germs that enter the body as ""foreign invaders” (called antigens) and produces proteins called antibodies to fight them. The first time a child is infected with a specific antigen (say measles virus), the immune system produces antibodies designed to fight it. This takes time . . . usually the immune system can’t work fast enough to prevent the antigen from causing disease, so the child still gets sick.  However, the immune system “remembers” that antigen. If it ever enters the body again, even after many years, the immune system can produce antibodies fast enough to keep it from causing disease a second time. This protection is called immunity. It would be nice if there were a way to give children immunity to a disease without their having to get sick first. In fact there is: Vaccines contain the same antigens (or parts of antigens) that cause diseases. For example, measles vaccine contains measles virus. But the antigens in vaccines are either killed, or weakened to the point that they don’t cause disease. However, they are strong enough to make the immune system produce antibodies that lead to immunity. In other words, a vaccine is a safer substitute for a child’s first exposure to a disease. The child gets protection without having to get sick. Through vaccination, children can develop immunity without suffering from the actual diseases that vaccines prevent. Top of Page More Facts Newborn babies are immune to many diseases because they have antibodies they got from their mothers. However, this immunity goes away during the first year of life. If an unvaccinated child is exposed to a disease germ, the child's body may not be strong enough to fight the disease. Before vaccines, many children died from diseases that vaccines now prevent, such as whooping cough, measles, and polio. Those same germs exist today, but because babies are protected by vaccines, we don’t see these diseases nearly as often. Immunizing individual children also helps to protect the health of our community, especially those people who cannot be immunized (children who are too young to be vaccinated, or those who can’t receive certain vaccines for medical reasons), and the small proportion of people who don’t respond to a particular vaccine. Vaccine-preventable diseases have a costly impact, resulting in doctor's visits, hospitalizations, and premature deaths. Sick children can also cause parents to lose time from work.

"Thank you so much. No information other than that she was resting and that the bleed was small. They said that they would try their best, but wouldnt guarantee anything. Thats all the doctor told her son. :\/","Well, that's certainly not very helpful or enlightening at all :\/ Idk your aunt's medical history, how the bleed occurred, or what intervention's her medical team has already performed so far. However, it's reassuring that the bleed is reportedly small. Important things that would be good to ask would be:-What interventions have been performed so far, and why? Also, which interventions\/procedures can be expected in the future? -How severe is the bleed, and what deficits can be expected following recovery vs. what are the chances of a full recovery (note, they likely won't commit to a specific answer to this question, because there's no good way to predict patient outcome, but notifies the care team that you're actively involved in the patient's care and want to be kept in the loop)? -What does the recovery time\/process look like if\/when her bleed improves? -Are there any additional co-complications going on? -is there any specialized care that is going to be required following recovery? -How often can we expect patient updates from the doc in the future? -Does the providing physician have any specific concerns of their own that we should be aware of?Additionally, it's probably worth asking what support is provided by the hospital that's available for friends\/family of the patient. If you have any additional information to share, please post here so that specific questions can be appropriately addressed."

Is he bed bound? in children with significant skeletal deformities or minimal ambulation, kidney stones are very common.

I have saracodism (lung) now I have lumps starting at the elbow going up the arm. My arm aches at night so bad I wake up rubbing it lightly. Both hands hurt and when I get up I can barely open and bend them. Is it all related to sarcoidosis or something else. Im scared.,"Welcome to Chat Doctor. 1. In the symptoms and history suggest possible cause for the above symptoms are enlarged lymph nodes.2. In this case you need to get a thorough study about the lung infection and its extensions. As lymph nodes enlargement is due to presence of any infection / inflammation or malignancies.3. The other possible cause could be dilated and tortious veins and suspicious of thrombosis - which need an upper limb vascular Doppler study. 4. In this case you need to workup with the issues with ultrasound, CT chest to evaluate the cause.5. Suggest you to see your treating doctor / GP and request for further investigations and treatment.

i suffer from Deviated Nasal Septum and therefore have nasal blockage every night and this has started from last 3 yrs especially after my dads demise which made me sad and worrysome and in trauma.  My question is if dns causes nasal blockage why did it not occur before 3 yrs and i will not go for surgery so please advice allopath or homeopath medicine to cure it.  thanks for your time sir.,"Hello and thanks for using this forum. I am very sorry for your loss. A deviated Nasal septum (DNS) is either post-traumatic like after an accident or congenital that since birth. In either the patient gives a history of obstructed breathing through the nose since birth or since the trauma. The other most likely cause for the nose block that you are experiencing is allergic rhinitis. The allergies in the human body can be due to altered immunity in response to allergens in the environment or mental stress. In your case I feel that the demise of your father could be trigger for the hypersensitivity causing the allergic rhinitis. In such a case surgery will not really be of great help. I shall be able to suggest the best HOM med for you if you can answer the following questions What is your body type -lean / overweight /flabby /Muscular ? What are your favorite foods ? How much salt and sour do you like ? Do you also get discharge from nose, sneezing at any time of the day ? Any relation to weather ? Thanks and take care. Chat Doctor. Chat Doctor .com/doctors/"
"Hello, could you please give me right direction. my father got sudden brainstroke, his left side leg and hand got paralysis .Also he is not able to speak.still 15days left, he take food through pipe and also urinal pipe connected.he iz 76yrs old.As per doctors advise more than 6to 8 months urinal pipe and feeing pipe required for my father. As per Doctor L D Padhi, Doctor- Kalinga Hospital, BBSR: 1/4th part of leftsite brain got blood clots.he cant give me right duration when my father got well( means he can take food through mouth, for urine urinal pipe not required) please suggest me for my fathers well treatment.","Dear Mr Petra, Usually after an ischemic stroke, the part of the brain that has been completely destroyed because of lack of blood supply does not recover its function. It is the surrounding areas of the brain which will need to take over the function of the affected part. This will take time and especially in an elderly gentleman like your father, it may not happen completely. Therefore, it is possible that he will be left with some extent of permanent paralysis. Once he has come out successfully from the acute hospitalization he will definitely improve, but the improvement will be gradual and most likely incomplete. Eventually, the doctors will attempt to remove his feeding tube and urinary catheter, UT when it may happen is difficult to predict.  I would assume that the side of paralysis is Left sided arms and legs? This is because his left brain is affected and this controls the opposite side arm and leg function and the speech in right-handed individuals. Hope this helps."

I went to the doctor and he said i pulled a muscle. But I am still nauseated and my head feels heavier than it should.","Hello! I understand your concern. In my opinion this may be something more serious than a muscular contraction. The pain you are having, and the gradual increase mean that something is happening in this region. It may be a cervical or thoracic disc bulge, a spinal tumor or an infection located in your column or UN the surrounding tissues. The headache and nausea may be signs of an infection. Have had fever during these days? I would recommend you to go to the doctor, have a physical examination, a routine blood test for infection, a service- thoracic x-ray, followed by a service- thoracic CT scan.Finally, if this diagnosis ate ruled out further exams may be needed for gastrointestinal or heart problems.

It's advisable to stop at the earliest. Numerous dentists nowadays offer Smoking Cessation Tips if you are interested in kicking off the habit. For the gum infection please visit a dentist (preferably a Periodontist) to get your teeth cleaned (Scaling & Root Planing) once every 3 months depending upon how much you smoke. It's also important to clean your tongue with a tongue cleaner, or you can use the same brush & paste though gently. Which Toothpaste & Mouth wash do you use?"

Detailed Answer:Hello Welcome to Chat Doctor. My name is Chat Doctor. I have gone through your query and would try to help you in the best possible way. Allergies in most of the cases stay with us through our whole lives, it is us who have to learn to control them and to live a good quality life with them. Allergy needs a step wise approach :(1) Meeting a Doctor.(2) Blood and other tests(3) Diagnosing type of Allergy(4) Figuring out what causes allergy (allergen)(4) How severe is it, or it can go(5) What med can control kit(6) What med controls it best(7) Sooner of later that med needs to be aided with some other med or have to be changed.(8) What are the risk factors.(9) Does the patient qualify to steroids or not? Suggestions: I have already told you how would I approach this issue, it needs proper check-ups and follow up to be controlled and treated well, for the time being if I were your doctor I would suggest you take an antihistamine for example loratadine 10 mg daily and an over the counter Painkiller+anti-inflammatory like Tylenol(acetaminophen) 325 mg thrice daily, But this is just to buy time till you can have a good contact with your doctor and all you reports are compiled and diagnosis is made...some people also need steroid to suppress allergy.CONCLUSION: Don't be alarmed there are doctors and clinics specialized in Allergy and it's a daily routine matter for them just follow this issue well and soon as you get settled on a med ...just one or two pills a day, and you will live a long healthy comfortable life .....

"According to what I found online, Mount Sinai has the only genetic test for porphyria. Trust me, I had a couple hundred dollars ready to spend on the genetic testing but everyone I spoke to who was versed in this stuff said it wouldnt make a difference","TF is going on in here? What is wrong with all of you people? None of you are physicians, I doubt even medical professionals, and even the ""best"" ""written"" comments in here are absolute drivel. You are NOT being helpful. You are torturing someone while stoking a House, MD type fantasy.Dear OP, I sympathize with you. Dealing with a sick kid is trying and tough and this awful thread is NOT useful to your mind state NOR your health.A problem I have noticed in my short career has been clear communications to patients. I highly doubt after 4 hospitals, 14 specialists, and however many other physicians and staff that no one has come up with a diagnosis. What does this mean? I bet at minimum you had multiple different teams with multiple different personnel working on your daughter's case. It's possible the primary team wasn't doing their damn job of synthesizing all of the specialists information into easy to understand information and presenting that information to you. Even when we don't ""know"" what's going on, I can still call something idiopathic (as in I don't know) or I can throw out a variety of possible causes in what we call a differential diagnosis.To everyone saying ""gEt GEnEtIC tEsTiNG"". That's not even how any of this works. Even if we were to use ""genetic testing"" this would only confirm the diagnosis, NOT LEAD US TO THE DIAGNOSIS. Even then it is absolutely unnecessary for treatment in this case. Genetic testing is useful when we are performing family planning or working on research on illnesses. To my knowledge, and I'm open to any updates, bread and butter medicine does not YET have the tools to use genetic testing in the fashion many of you seem to think exists."
"F30. Ive had these transient episodes of PSVT for some years now, following an Epstein Barr infection when I was 22. Ive had a cardiology referral before, with a 3 day monitor. It caught nothing, so they diagnosed me with Anxiety and sent me away with a low dose of Propanolol if I wanted it.These heart episodes are making my life a living hell. They are destroying my relationships and my ability to function in my daily life. I used to work, but now I dont. Ive had to give up my job because I couldnt cope with the interrupted sleep (they specifically wake me up from a sound sleep, usually around 3am). This is obviously very frustrating for both myself and my partner.Went to ER with chest pain after the last episode, and the ER doc wanted to get me a 21 day heart monitor - which would definitely catch it as my episodes appear in clusters, a few times a month. There appears to be a hormonal component to it.Ive completely cut out caffeine but the effect that has had on it has been minimal.Now, the NHS is saying that they will refer me to cardiology when my anemia is sorted. But, its never sorted - at least, not without iron infusion therapy (I have IBS and dont tolerate oral tablets well).I did have an iron infusion months ago, which picked my Hb levels to no longer anemic - but didnt get the referral then either. On the contrary, I heard nothing from my GP, for months, and now Im back to being anemic again - its so hard to maintain my iron levels without routine IV iron, and the only time I get it is if Im in hospital for another reason (last time was Gynae related).Im beginning to lose hope that this will ever be resolved and worry that Im just going to drop dead of an unidentified cardiology issue.Is there any way I can get the cardiology appointment and have my cardiologist take me seriously instead of attributing it to anemia like last time, because my resting HR is 60bpm, these SVT episodes are a very distinct and immediate jump to a hr of about 170-200bpm, and they arent anxiety related at all. They also definitely arent anemia related because even when I am no longer anemic, I still get them. Twice monthly, around the times I ovulate and right before my period. Predictable as clockwork.I just want them to stop because they make me afraid to sleep at night and as a result I have developed pretty terrible insomnia, and depression due to the constant fear of wondering if something is severely wrong with me.",I dont understand why you had to give up your job if they only happen twice a month like you say?

I understand your concern and would explain that your symptoms may be related to a low blood pressure or a metabolic disorder (thyroid dysfunction, a Chat Doctor. ). The fact that this occurs only in a certain position or a certain physical activity is indicative that it is not a serious medical condition. It doesn't seem to be related to any cardiac disorders (based on the symptomatology). Have you measured your blood pressure during these episodes? Orthostatic hypotension, could also explain this clinical scenario. I recommend consulting with a GP for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG, a chest x-ray and some blood lab tests: - complete blood count-kidney and liver function tests-thyroid hormone levels-cortisol plasma levels-fasting glucose-blood electrolytes, etc. A head up tilt tests is needed to rule in/out a possible orthostatic hypotension.

Don't loose heart .  Today every thing is curable . A cough is a reflex action to clear your airways of mucus and irritants such as dust or smoke.

"(Almost) 4yo Boy, Many Symptoms, No AnswersBorn 3\/2019.Waking up at night from a dead sleep with leg pain for nearly a year now. Happens once or twice a month usually. Right leg more frequently. Chalked up to growing pains. When he wakes up, give him Tylenol, get the heating pad out and wrap his legs. Rub his back and he falls asleep. Seems fine in the morning. Sometimes has complained of pain during the day, but could be a ploy for medicine. Points to his shins, knees, and thighs as sources of pain.Complains of headaches occasionally (I've never even heard the word, ""headache"" come out of his older brother's mouth). Goes away with Tylenol.Was vomiting a lot last year. I started tracking and the average was 1.5x a month. No fever or other symptoms; would complain of nausea, boot, then be back to normal within an hour. Went to pediatrician on 8\/19\/22, she recommended we go to the ER because we could get all testing done rapidly and at once. Went to ER, had bloodwork done (normal at the time, no cancer markers), was diagnosed with cyclical vomiting syndrome. Debated on whether to do a CAT scan or MRI, opted to not. Has only vomited 1x since then, was this past October. Not much nausea or vomiting since.Swollen lymph node in armpit and back of neck, both on left side. Just discovered armpit one today. Neck node has been enlarged for over six months. No biopsy, superficial exams by multiple doctors, all advise this is normal and not a concern. Soft, movable, and less than 2cm in size. Hasn't grown.He often just looks pale compared to the rest of the family (we are white, British decent), but could be chalked up to recent rainy weather and being stuck indoors for winter. He also seems thinner than the rest of us, just bonier than his older brother was. Always craves sweets. Weight and height are good, around 70th percentile.I found swelling in the back of his knee four weeks ago. Right posterior, left of the popliteal fossa, about the size of an avocado pit. Puffy, not hard. Took him to the pedi two weeks ago, and she said likely a cyst, but referred me to an orthopedic surgeon for further evaluation. Have appointment this Friday to get it checked (she said probably an ultrasound). She also checked him for a wet cough that he's had for over two months. Said she heard crackling in his lungs, prescribed inhaler, doesn't seem to be helping, will have a follow up next week to check his lungs again. Cough is annoying, but not really impacting day-to-day activities. Still very active and happy kid.Went on a long walk today and he woke up again with knee pain, said only right one hurts. Did the usual late-night treatment and now he's asleep.I am debating on whether to take him to the ER again. Our firstborn was healthy as a horse, never in the ER and sick with typical symptoms. I don't want to be too overzealous with an appointment coming up, but all of these symptoms just have my mom radar screaming there's something really wrong with him. I assume the ortho won't do another blood panel at the time, so it'll be a referral if they find something wrong. I just don't know if I want to keep dragging out discovery appointments for the next few weeks vs. going to the ER and asking for the gamut of tests.Any feedback at all is appreciated. We have a PPO and are financially stable, so cost isn't an issue.","I've usually noticed that when your mom radar is screaming, it's better to take your kid to the ER. The symptoms you have mentioned could be due to a viral infection, but I'm still perplexed as to why the doctors decided against the CT or MRI and did they perform abdominal Ultrasound?. Also , cyclic vomiting syndrome can cause dehydration, lethargy , pallor, and muscle weakness. I hope he's taking his fluids well."

If she has seen her menses after this unprotected sex episodes, then it is unlikely that she is again pregnant. However, have you had any unprotected sex after her last menses? Doing a rapid pregnancy test is the standard of care when you have not seen your menses. This will give an instant answer. I will not be particularly worried at this time because menses may come earlier or later than expected. But if it should delay for more than a week, then please run a rapid test. If you are afraid of unwanted pregnancies, I suggest you both meet and talk with your physician on what other options are available if you don't want to use protection during sex.

On reading your question I feel that you should meet a doctor in person and get your husband examined. Had I been treating him I would check his blood pressure, may need an ECG, routine blood tests. You have not mentioned if your husband is aware of these symptoms himself while having it or not? But still I think it will be wise to get a CAT scan head done to check if everything is right in brain. The symptom you have described can be in case of high blood pressure or may be due to some kind of minor seizure like activity in brain....

I have 2 Tarlov cysts on spine and 2 herniated disc done Mir therapy reg injections I have never experience pain like this in my life 4 children no deme role age 54 please suggest should do go for epidural or surgery. Doctors aren t familiar with this.,"Hi, Taylor cysts should not worry you since they are not treated and not the cause of your pain. Herniated disks, however, are the source of your pain. If you have not been tried on conservative measures such as physical or aqua therapy as well as standard medications for the pain then, I highly advise you do this before considering surgery.  Have you tried traction, hot/cold therapy, acupuncture, or other forms of complementary medicine?  If, however, there is a loss of power or loss of mass in the muscles of the leg affected then, surgery may very well have to be done, but I would say not until more serious complications have occurred. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. "

"Hello My daughter is 7 months n 3 weeks her weight is 14 pounds is that way too less for her age,she was not very good with gaining weight. And secondly we were in India for 6 weeks for first 2 weeks she used frequently vomit either her solids or milk.. then I guess she got some what adjusted n even gained some weight.. its been 2 weeks we came back to US.. for first week she was fine but now almost for last 2 weeks she is vomiting daily.. her solids as well as her milk... milk only when she cries... for example I give her n put her to sleep if she wakes n starts crying within a minute she coughs a little n vomit.For solids at times I used to feel may be I am overfeeding her,but for last couple of days she shows signs as if she will vomit only after eating couple of spoons.She coughs a little n at times seem to clear her throat.. I am very worried that she ll start loosing weight or will not gain properly.. Plz help","Hi, thank you for posting on Chat Doctor, I understand your concern as a mother. I feel that your kid might be having severe Castro esophageal reflux disease (GOOD) which explains her vomiting and poor weight gain. Has she undergone any pH studies? Upper GI Barium studies or any other with related to above condition? Her vomiting is unlikely due to over feeding as in that case she should have gained weight even though she vomits. Changes of her living areas can't be considered as a cause for her symptoms too. Anyway if you can submit any of above investigations I would have explained more. Thank you."
I have been married for almost 9 years. my husband is a very angry and verbally hatefull person. he puts people down including our 8 and 9 year old sons. he is more mean to our youngest son which is his son and nicer to our oldest which is not his biologically (our oldest son doesnt know he is not his biologically). he does very mean things that he know will get a reaction like instigating the kids and myself then yell at us when we get mad cause he thinks its funny(example cleaning our youngest sons ears with q-tip then put the dirty q-tip in his mouth casue he thought it was funny then yelled at me for getting mad and yelled at son for crying) what do i do and how do i get him to get help. I have threatened to leave in the past. he is in army and does deploy and hoinestly i have less problems when he is gone,"Degree understand your concerns went through your details.

"I had a filling changed for right upper first molar, but in 2 weeks I was having intolerable headache, pain in ear, tongue, jaw and surrounding areas. The doc re-opened the filling and found pulpitis, said his drilling might have exposed pulp. I was prescribed anti-biotics for a week and he did root-canal. 3 canals were found and filled, on top of the filling he put cotton stuffing and then the temporary filling. He had already used up all of my insurance on the fillings, so said the permanent filling could be done in an year. Is it safe to wait for an year, I am not really sure if he did the sealing properly.","Hello, After pulpits and root canal therapy, there will be a period of healing required before the tooth feels better. The antibiotic should help to heal and reduce inflammation. Take some anti-inflammatory medication such as Tylenol or Motrin. Return to your dentist for a follow-up visit if it is not improving or feels worse. Do you hit the tooth hard when you bite? You may need the tooth adjusted to reduce stress. I recommend taking an X-ray. Consider getting an evaluation by an endodontist. This is a root canal specialist. I do not recommend restoring the tooth until it is comfortable. A hidden canal might exist or pretreatment may be necessary. I do not recommend leaving the tooth in a temporary filling for a year. You risk fracture, and it can continue to decay without causing pain. Plan to progress with a restoration. For back molars, I recommend a post and core with a crown. Sometimes, I place the post and core with plans to place the crown at a later time. Also, a temporary crown to prevent fracture, can be placed for a longer period of time to allow monitoring of the progression of healing with this tooth. Thank you for your inquiry."

"Please forgive my ignorance, this is genuine confusion and not sarcasm or anything like that but I'm really not understanding how anything is relevant behind the time at which formula milk goes bad at room temperature. Whether he's fed 10ml an hour or 1 liter an hour into his stomach or his bowel, the fact would remain that the rate at which milk would spoil at room temperature would be a constant - I'm having difficulty understanding why the answer is not straightforward that 'formula cannot sit unused at room temperature for xyz hours' as an example. Nothing unique to him or his situation would make milk sat at room temperature last longer - at least that I can think of - but if I am being ignorant to something that changes everything then please tell me so I can learn.Right now in my head I'm having trouble getting away from the concept of whether I eat chicken in 2 bites or 17 or whether I put it in a blender or I eat it fried, it would still be unfit for consumption if it were first left out for a period of time. And given that we believe the nurse is doing something we've been told is bad, it wouldn't make sense to ask her because she wouldn't contradict herself. It makes more sense to me to look for a consensus from different professionals.For his feed, that's my bad referring to it as an IV, it's in a bag that hangs up on a pole and is administered slowly over 4 hours at 45ml per hour. We give him 180ml and change the bag every 4 hours. The line runs through a kangaroo thing that pumps it into his bowel through a J port in a button on his chest. Instead of 180ml at 45 per hour for 4 hours the night nurse is feeding him 360ml in the bag over 8 hours at the same rate so just doubling the contents of the bag and leaving the bag at room temperature for 8 hours while it is administered into him","It's not milk though is it?

"Respiratory restrictive pattern, unknown cause please help.I am 21 years old male.I have started having bad shortness of breath the past 4 months. I have seen so many doctors and this is the results so far.The originally test to prove there is something going on is the respiratory function test, I cant interpret all the results but the pulmologist said my breathing shows a restrictive pattern with 65% of expected lung capacity and velocity. This test has been repeated every month with similar results. Gas transfer was 95-100% not indicating lung disease.Got a ct scan of chest with dye to rule out lung disease or to see if anything else is on my lungs but it came back clear other than enlarged thymus gland.They thought it might be respritory muscle weakness although the neurologist said unlikely as when I am lying down the respiratory test shows similar results as to standing.Cardiac possibilities cleared by cardiologist.The cardiologist, pulmologist and neurologist are at a loss and have determined to just hope it doesnt get worse. Please help.","Restrictive pattern on PFTs essentially fall into three categories, unfortunately you've had them all investigated. It can be the lungs themselves (i.e. fibrosis, or stiff lungs), chest wall noncompliance (think of terrible scoliosis, severe obesity, etc), or neuromuscular disease. The first two are typically pretty easy to diagnose, neuromuscular disease can be very difficult. There is no gold standard for how to determine if restriction is related to neuromuscular disease, but the sitting\/supine spirometry is often done as one piece of data (as it appears you have done).Have you done a MIP\/MEP (maximal inspiratory pressure and maximal expiratory pressure)? A low MIP tends to indicate diaphragmatic problems, and a low MEP indicates problems with chest wall strength. Like the sitting\/supine spirometry, these must be interpreted with caution, as they are not truly gold standard for anything.If all else fails, there is always the Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test (CPET). It's basically a test that measures your heart and lung function through maximal exercise to determine where exercise intolerance may be coming from. It's not always available in all places and can be very difficult to interpret.All in all, with your story I would put my money on a neuromuscular issue. I think the neurologist ruling it out based on the positional spirometry alone is premature. Bring up the MIP\/MEP and CPET to your pulmonologist and see what he\/she thinks.Mind if I ask where you are being evaluated? You would likely benefit from going to a tertiary care center, such as affiliated with an academic or university medical center. Depending on where you are located I could suggest some places to find docs who'd be interested in you."

The causes maybe various-food items, dust, pollen, outdoor plants, any recent outdoor activity, new cosmetics or jewelry(earrings), also could be due to sun exposure which may have aggravated an allergy.

"low neutrophils high lymphocytes pediatricMy son is 3 years old. Got a ton of blood work for his weight I guess. He's 27lbs. He has high energy and no concerns other than occasional constipation. The blood work came back with low neutrophils 21% and high lymphocytes 71% (which has me sick to my stomach thanks to Google. WBC, RBC and hemoglobin is normal. Hematocrit is low 32.9% with the range min of 34%. His neutrophils absolute is 1.56 which is in range but on the low end of the range that says the min is 1.50. Lymphocytes absolute is in range. All morphology is normal. His ferritin is low at 23 with the standard low being 36. Everything else is normal. They did a lipid panel which I didn't have him fast as no one informed me. And his triglycerides were pretty high at 238mg\/dl. He had half a sugar cookie an hour before and I was feeding the other half during his blood draw to distract him. VLDL was high at 48mg. Everything was normal on lipid. Carbon dioxide was low at 17.0mm.","First off keep in mind the percentages always have to add up to 100. So either the neutrophils are low because the lymphocytes are high, or the lymphocytes look high because the neutrophils are low. So he's got one problem, not two. Based on the other values my guess is that it's probably the low neutrophils but I'd have to see the absolute numbers.His iron is a little low but otherwise everything else is normal. Do you have a hard time getting him to eat meat? Because it's likely just dietary.In general, I really recommend against googling labs because it always comes up with scary stuff. Those aren't cancer values if that's what you're worried about. Could be he's fighting off an infection, could be related to a malabsorption issue or dietary deficiency, could just be normal for him.If it were my patient or my child I would think it's not likely a big deal, but would want to recheck at some point in the next few months to see if it changes. Keeping in mind I'm a family doctor and not a pediatrician, so they may have a slightly different plan."
"when im talking to some one .... and i get the feeling that the heat of this chat is going up ... my hands shake ... i hear my heart beats .... like im scared to death !!! it embarrasses me a lot ... makes me skip important chats, makes me skip what i really want to say. please help.","Hello, I think you have anxiety issues. This doesn't look like social phobia as you have problem while talking only. Do you feel anxious of trivial issues or most of the time of the day? If the answer is yes, then you need to take antianxiety medicines as this might increase if left untreated and make it difficult for you to work. Late treatment also makes the problem chronic. There are several safe and good medicines available nowadays like, Escitalopram and sertraline. Please go to a doctor and discuss the problem in person and in detail. Regular exercise and deep breathing also helps, but nothing is as important and as effective as the correct medicine. Good luck. "

"Thanks for the responseAh, that makes sensebummer that they dont provide the full EKG, I shouldve taken a picture. Ill update this post if I somehow get it.Theyre not having any symptoms anymore, aside from the anxiety.Troponin is <6 ng\/L. D-dimer is <270 ng\/mL.Echo summary: The left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness are normal. Left ventricular systolic function is normal. There are no segmental left ventricular wall motion abnormalities noted. The estimated ejection fraction is 60% The right ventricular size is normal. The right ventricular systolic function is normal. Normal valve structure and function.Reason for exam: eval in ED with CP x 4 days, EKG showed TWI inferolateral leads, trop <6, Dimer wnl, no history of Covid. Persistent tachycardia. Abnormal EKG Palpitations","Thank you. So labs and the echo are normal. TWI is not an indication for cardiac MRI. TWI in inferolateral leads can even be due to things like lead misplacement.I think it would be in your partners best interest to ask the ordering NP how the cardiac MRI would impact their care. If it's positive for myocarditis, what will they do to treat it? (The answer is probably nothing). If it is negative for myocarditis, what will they do to treat it? (Also nothing) Secondly, it could be in their best interest to discuss this test and their care with a physician.Gotta give you a disclaimer: My assessment and recommendations are based on the information provided and I have not seen the EKG, taken a history from the patient, or performed a physical exam. I don't want to sow mistrust and am not attempting to disagree with other medical personnel, since the ordering NP has performed all of these assessments."

Another aspect to note is that patients who see palliative care earlier have a much better prognosis - longer survival times and higher quality of life scores.,"Pulmonologist here. I am also the medical director of a hospice for the last 15 years. First, I am very sorry for the difficulty that you, your father, and your family are having to deal with. As a physician, and particularly in doing pulmonary\/critical care as well as hospice, I have tried to help people through these tough situations for most of my career. Each case is individual and each patient is an individual with their own beliefs and values and dreams.Over the years, I've spoken to many dying patients and their families about their illness, and what I've tried to do is to give them the perspective of a physician in order that they can then use their own values and beliefs within the framework of a physician's perspective...using what we know and applying their own perspective.As a physician, my perspective on your father is that he is dying. Please don't take that as callous...it is not meant that way. Most people think of dying as a moment...and it certainly can be...car wreck, heart attack, massive stroke... those thinks can take a life in the blink of an eye. However, for many, if not most, people...dying is a process. It can be several hours or several weeks...or longer It begins when you know that nothing else can be done for the patient and all you are trying to do is maintain, and despite your best efforts, the trend is that the patient continues to decline. All patient's have good days and they have bad days, but for a dying patient, when you average it out, the trend is that they continue to worsen.It's at this point that I think it's important to find out what kind of death your father really wants. That can sound very brutal to some people...but remember, we're physicians and we experience this life and death everyday, and we see patients who die peacefully and comfortably and we see patient's who die alone and in horrible circumstances. With those experiences in mind and with our practicality, we begin to think about what we would want for ourselves. Ask any physician or nurse friend of yours...chances are they've thought about it a lot...far more than other people. They tend to know exactly how far they're willing to go before they just want comfort.From your post, you've spoken to your Dad about his care:He's expressed that no matter how small the chance is, he wants to continue fighting. We've had this talk serveral times throughout the years. Even now he expresses this. Which is why I'm trying to explore every realm of possibility.When he says ""chance,"" what does he mean? Chance of a cure?...chance to go back home?...chance to get a little better and be off the ventilator? In other words, you need to know what his goals are. If his goal is cure, there is no chance. If his goal is going home to the way his life had been...there probably is little chance of that either, though there may be a chance to go home...I don't have enough information. But first, find out which of his goals are potentially achievable with his doctors. Once you know what goals are potentially achievable for your father, you and his doctors can talk about what would have to happen to achieve those goals.Eventually...at some point however, because of the nature of our existence, none of those goals will be achievable, and at that point it is reasonable to give your father permission to let go and to seek comfort in the final moments, days, or weeks of his life. I say that because many patients continue to fight because they think that's what they're suppose to do or because they think they'll be letting down their family if they let go. They endure unnecessary suffering because no one has offered them a path of comfort and acceptance or because they made a vow to fight on and they don't want to renege on a promise they made to someone.We all eventually die. Some of us will never know what hit us because it comes too quickly. For those of us who are struck with a terminal illness like cancer, the only benefit is that we may have enough time to get our personal affairs in order and make peace while having some control over the dying process. As a physician, I know how I'd want to die, however, I don't try to push that on any of my patients. There are definitely patients who don't want to do much at all and just want to enjoy what life they have left. There are other patients who can't die in peace without trying everything including investigational treatments. I respect them all but as a physician I have to make sure that they are making those decisions knowing all the facts and the possibilities and risks.Start by talking to your father about his goals and discussing those goals with your father and his doctors. Give your father permission to do what he wants whether it's letting go or fighting to his last breath. And make sure that in the end, his comfort and wishes guide what decisions you may have to make in his stead. I hope this helped a bit. As best as I can on a reddit post, I'd like to give you, your father, and your family a big hug and my wishes that you all will be comforted in the days ahead."

Do you have information about Infant and Newborn Development,"Summary : When will my baby take his first step or say her first word? During their first year, babies start to develop skills they will use for the rest of their lives. The normal growth of babies can be broken down into the following areas:       - Gross motor - controlling the head, sitting, crawling, maybe even starting to walk    - Fine motor - holding a spoon, picking up a piece of cereal between thumb and finger    - Sensory - seeing, hearing, tasting, touching and smelling    - Language - starting to make sounds, learning some words, understanding what people say     - Social - the ability to play with family members and other children       Babies do not develop at the same rate.

Injection Vidal contains the hormone human chorionic gonadotrophin. It is given to cause release of ova (egg) from mature ovum. It does not cause delay in the period. The delay could be due to pregnancy. Get a pregnancy test done. Are you taking progesterone like phaeton? Progesterone can cause some delay in periods. Good luck.

How is he after you give the fever medicine? Is he active and eating well? Fever can be due to a viral or bacterial infection. Aside from the throat pain, does he have colds or cough? For most viral infections, the patients appear well after given antipyretic (fever medicine like Eugenic or Paracetamol) in between fever episodes. The throat infection caused by viruses is usually accompanied by colds. Viral infections are not given antibiotics like Azithromycin or Brian. It is mainly supportive like giving fever medicine, lots of fluids, antibacterial gargle. Fever caused by viral infections can last from 3 days to a week. After 3 days, you will notice the fever to go down and the patient will show improvement already. You may try to check his throat to see if the tonsils are red and swollen sometimes with streaks of pus. If you see this, chances are the throat infection is caused by a bacteria like streptococcus or what we call as the strep throat. Patients who have strep throat can also have severe headache, difficulty swallowing, sometimes with rashes. Bacterial throat infection will be more sick looking compared to that caused by viruses. For this you will need antibiotics that is properly computed based on your children weight. I hope I was able to help you. Sincerely, Handle Dulay-See, M.D. Pediatrics"

I am taking a 200mg capsule of lomexin...fenticonazole nitrate and i use verdal cream...my husband uses the verdal cream too","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor! I understand your query. Well there are several causes of recurrent infections. Primarily, your immune status may not be up to mark i.e. you might be having some immune deficiency. Ensure a proper balanced diet with good eggs and non-veg intake if you are a non-vegetarian, as they are a rich source of proteins. Soybean is also a rich source of proteins. You might want to get investigated to find out the cause of this immune deficiency. Another common cause of recurrent infections is Diabetes. I'd strongly advice you to get a fasting and post radial blood glucose test done to find out your diabetes status. Thirdly, are you sure it's a yeast infection? I'd suggest you to visit a gynecologist and get it examined to rule out any other condition. Hope this information helps. Feel free to ask if to have any doubt. Wishing you a speedy recovery.

You are not a candidate for IV nutrition. So presumably a gastroenterologist diagnosed you with erosive gastritis after an endoscopy?

"Hi, and thanks for checking up on me. I have not yet figured out why I cannot move in the daytime, but in the dark and at night I can. I considered hemochromatosis, but the symptoms don t really fit. I have started an herbal tea medicine to work on the bone marrow, and it seems to be very slowly improving. But I still can t explain why it happens in the first place. Thank you for your help. It is very appreciated. - elaine silverman","Hi Elaine, Thanks for asking. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. No, hemochromatosis does not cause difficulty to walk. 2. I am not sure if it is anything related to hemochromatosis as you can walk at nights and not in day. Are you able to move your limbs during daytime? If you are able to move any of the limbs, then you will require psychological support and counseling.3. Routine hologram along with serum iron investigations will give a guide on hemochromatosis. Liver biopsy can confirm it. If more details are available regarding investigations and clinical history, I can be more helpful. Hope it helps. Any further queries, happy to help again."

"I would test Seum Copper levels and Zinc. Copper deficiency can cause peripheral neuropathy, histamine intolerance (copper is a cofactor of DAO), dysautonomia (copper is a cofactor of DBH, required to convert dopamine to norepinephrine), EKG abnormalities.Copper deficiency can be caused by zinc toxicity, and zinc has become a very popular supplement ""to prevent"" COVID. Too much zinc supplementation without Copper can lead to copper deficiency.We havent looked into that. She doesnt take any zinc supplements so were not sure what would cause her to have copper deficiency or zinc toxicity. Well write it down to mention to her PCP at her next appointment.She has been checked for carcinoid syndrome. Her GI doctor suggested it and she had both the CgA blood test and 24-hour urine 5-HIAA test that luckily both came back in normal range.","I agree with another poster - she needs to have a PCP that can consolidate her information and testing to help you guide where to go next. I think you keeping this list is fantastic to help you advocate for yourselves.There are a few things here:The white plaques found on the colonoscopy Spring 2021 is of very high interest especially given that the cause was not determined. Was it ever biopsied? It may be worth another repeat C-scope because it sounds like the most recent direct visualization was an EGD. Low grade colitis from inflammatory bowel disease doesnt always show up on a CT scan.I also think her autoimmune workup is incomplete from the blood work listed. In addition to this, viral illnesses (such as the one she had in 2019 that may or may not have been COVID) often can trigger the beginning of an autoimmune condition. The blood work ANA and RF is by no means comprehensive. Why was an RF checked? Was she having joint pain as well? With a family history, autoimmune conditions are very high on my listnose symptoms, lung symptoms, microscopic hematuria, peripheral nervous system issues beings up differentials including: GPA (granulomatosis with polyangitis previously known as Wegeners Granulomatosis) and Anti-GBM (Goodpasture) Disease which are autoimmune vasculitisI would recommend checking for vasculitis: ESR, CRP, C3\/4, ANCA, Anti-GBM, cryoglobulinsOther autoimmune conditions can manifest with GI issues too - there is a lot of overlap. Whether she has joint pain or not, I would check CCP, HLA B27, Sjogren panelSystemic scleroderma is a possibility too which would include Anti-Scl70 labsIf she has joint pain, a synovial ultrasound of the hands \/ feet may find active joint or tendon inflammation which would support an inflammatory condition as well.I hope this information can help bring your wife some answers and hopefully treatment"

"No biopsy due to concerns about infection\/wound not healing with the blood flow issues.You're right, I have no idea if they truly ruled out all autoimmune diseases. But I did have significant testing for it. The main hospital did all their own testing and when I was negative for everything, the doctor worked with Mayo Clinic and used their full autoimmune testing panel or whatever and was still negative for everything.I do remember some reasons coming up: no inflammation markers, negative ANA multiple times, 3 rheumatologists cleared me and told me it was vascular not rheumatological in origin. I was tested for and all the types of vasculitis (without biopsy just blood work).And these are some of the reasons I can remember for saying no to Buerger's:- My symptoms only come on in the dependent position and at no other time, all their tests showed no blockages or clogging or weird patterns of veins, no claudication, no blood clots, no change in symptoms when exposed to cold, and I think some more stuff. I know my vascular surgeon sent images and case history to some massive network of vascular specialists and the consensus was that it was not buergers (but again, who knows).My neurologist is absolutely convinced that I have Marfan syndrome but I did not get the genetic testing for it yet. And I'm not aware if that can cause this but it's the only other thing I can think of.EDIT: I just went through my mega document of all my labs and tests, and anti phospholipid syndrome could fit, because I do have a history of blood clots and also recurrent miscarriages (5 by the time I was 29). I am trying to find the exact lab names of the tests for this right now to confirm (that's always hard lol). (I found the names, I was tested for aCL IgG and IgM antibodies and results say<10 GPL<10 MPLThey also looked at regular IgA = 288.9, IgM = 50There's a bunch of other IgA and IgM and IgG tests in there too with other words in front of them that I don't understand but all seem normal.","Did they do lupus anticoagulant (LA) or anti-beta2 glycoprotein 1 (a(beta)2GPI) with those antibody tests? It sounds likely that those will have been covered in the workup described. If so then its unlikely to be anti phospholipid syndrome, at least from initial workup. Given the description of symptoms there is still a possibility of antibodies to other things such as anti prothrombin, anti-annexin, anti-phosphatidylserine, etc, but the clinical correlation is weak at this time and testing is not routinely performed since there is much uncertainty about their significance. It may be something a rheumatologist could speak to in more detail.One of the key criteria with testing though is that testing should occur within a short period of time from any event such as blood clots or miscarriage if I remember correctly. If it is not done within a short period of time it may not show up on testing (I dont routinely deal with APS so I dont know the timing recommendations). I could not say if the current cutaneous and vascular manifestations would be included, but a rheumatologist may be able advise further.I do agree it is worth another follow up and discussion with a rheumatologist again to discuss the possibility of the diagnoses in this thread, multiple good differentials on the list from other physicians as well. It sounds like youve already had an extensive workup, but at the end of the day if you have a progressive pathology and no answers, you have to keep searching and discussing it. Best of luck."

"Doctors please help my little sister, she can't walk, I'm afraid she's going to die8F, 78lbs, no medication. She was in the hospital for a long time but they discharged her. She is still in pain, please help. I attached the notes of her discharge.The patient is an 8-year-old white female with five weeks of fever, rash, arthralgias. Last month, the patient noted foot pain involving both left and right feet, as well as a blotchy pink rash on the leg that proceeded to spread to the trunk and then arms and then face during that week. The patient had low-grade fevers with temps to a max of 101. This has progressed to the week prior to admission higher fevers with T-max of 103.5. The patient has endorsed muscle pain, particularly in the right leg and arm, and PMD had seen the patient this week noted right knee and right index finger swelling. There is no noted weight change over this time period. No noted diarrhea or swollen nodes. The rash the patient described the week prior had an acute abrupt onset and 5-10 minutes later would dissipate.Rheumatology was consulted on the patient from admission. Lab studies were sent to rule-out an infectious etiology for rash. Strep culture was negative. EKG was also performed to rule-out a prolonged PR interval. EKG was within normal limits. A DNase B antibody was 547 and an ASO titer was 300. While results were elevated, the patient did no meet clinical criteria for rheumatic fever and diagnosis that was most likely entertained was systemic JIA. Further lab work included an ANA which was negative, rheumatoid factor which was negative, a CRP on admission was 8.6 mg\/dL with an ESR about 80. CK and aldolase were within normal limits. Ferritin was elevated at 663. LDH was within normal limits. CBC was reassuring with normal white counts, hemoglobin and platelets; findings nonsuggestive of leukemia. Hepatic panel within normal limits. A chest x-ray was done to rule-out mediastinal mass, and that was negative. From an infectious standpoint, Parvo, CMV, EBV were all negative. Clinically the patient was noted to have a salmon-colored transient rash that would come and go throughout the hospitalization lasting a matter of minutes. No definite arthritis on examination. Oncology was consulted given the history of arthritis and fevers. It was felt in the setting of normal cell lines in evaluating a smear, which revealed no blasts, no indication of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly and uric acid and LDH within normal limits and x-ray that was normal, they felt that further oncologic evaluation was not indicated and a bone marrow was not indicated at that time. Cardiology was also officially consulted because the patient had a 2\/6 ejection murmur on the exam. Cardiology felt the murmur was a flow murmur and evaluated the EKG, which they read as within normal limits, and decided an echo was not indicated to rule-out valvular disease in the setting of the rash and arthritis in an attempt to workup acute rheumatic fever.","Internal medicine doc here but in my differential is Adult Onset Stills Disease which can still present in children and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. The salmon colored rash lasting a few minutes is textbook for Adult Onset Stills Disease.I'm assuming she had blood cultures done at one or multiple points during her admission. Did she have a procalcitonin tested? Did she receive any antibiotics? Any steroids like solumedrol, prednisone etc? Does she still have joint pain? Does this rash show up only during febrile episodes? Any auto immune conditions in the family like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, hashimotos?"
I had my colon removed in May 2012 within a week after I had emergancy surgery for a twist in the small intestine .. every since Ihave had a severe pinching pain at the same side beside my Illiostomy..

Percocets .. they dont work and even Fentnyal patches all not touching the pain... an opinion would be great.. I dont know what to do..the pain is killing me.. Thank you.,"Dear sir, it is hard to believe that all these medicines can't help you. Did they think of pastoral hernia? It doesn't need to be seen on CT. If you have such a persistent pain then revision of ileostomy should be done. Complete colon removal is a mutilating procedure and many complications can be expected, but the source of pain must be evaluated. Diagnostic laparoscopy can be preformed. But also this could be neuropathic pain, so you can consult with your neurologist what to take. There are medicines such as Lyrics which can be helpful. Wish you good health."

"Pediatrician ordered blood work at the insistence of my husband after trying to say the fever was due to teething. Again. The CBC with differential came back normal, so they said. But in his medical records, it literally says abnormal in the comments. They also did a blood culture and when I asked about that, they said his preliminary results are fine and they were monitoring for the final results. For some reason, I cannot view this in his patient portal.We found something called PFAPA and are wondering if that's what we are dealing with.","You can post the cbc here if youd like. Its not uncommon for a lab result to flag as abnormal but actually be fine. Blood cultures probably dont appear in your portal until 5 days, but if its negative at 1-2 days then it will almost certainly remain negative. PFAPA is certainly possible, or HIDS, but doesnt really fit the fever pattern.Chronic subtle skin infection was my first thought but sounds like not the case. Could just be back to back to back viruses especially if there are intermittent fever-free days, or mono. Can I presume he doesnt have a central line? I wouldnt be surprised if the doctor tomorrow wants to admit him to the hospital to expedite more testing. We typically send blood for lots of less common infections and non infectious conditions, and sometimes ultrasound and\/or mri looking for signs of a site of infection. Please update here if youre comfortable doing so."
Hello. I keep having this stinging/twitich on my left side below collar bone area above the sternal notch. It brings me to my knees.

I have been haveing chest pain as well (left sided) comes and goes. I do have Cong. Heart Dz (pulm vavle stenosis & murmur). I have a cardiologist but have been in great cardiac health. Last ECHO & EKG were fine. Any suggestions. It s worrying me. I am not sure if i shoudl call the doc.,A few questions I would like answered. Does it come on or increase by walking or doing any physical work or just while doing routine work? Does it seem to worsen every time it comes? Does it come for a longer duration every time? If the answer to the three questions is yes then you have what is called angina. Either way you should definitely have yourself checked out

I'll try to keep this as short as possible as I know you're all busy.TL:DR - https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/m5lprmBWondering if anyone can offer an opinion on this ECG from my implanted loop recorder. The loop recorder was inserted 1.5 years ago to investigate a an episode of sustained arrhythmia + syncope. I have a history of AVRT (ablated in 2006, possibly WPW, but that wasn't made fully clear to me). It seems something didn't go quite right during the ablation and the AVRT was eliminated but I developed frequent PVCs that were not present before the procedure. I have some documented NSVT from holter monitors and 30 day loop recorders over the past 10 years.My loop recorder seems to not be programmed to detect much of anything on its own. I think I would have to literally be in v-fib for it to automatically flag an event for review. After about a year of it literally capturing nothing despite having symptoms, I requested a patient trigger device that I can use to force the device to record and upload an event. Since I have started using the trigger, I have been able to capture several episodes such as this: https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/m5lprmBWhen I look at this, my untrained sees a salvo of PVCs, which I guess technically defines NSVT. I have asked my doctor for an opinion on these events and every time his response is basically ""Doesn't look like anything to me"".What he doesn't seem to understand or appreciate is I find these episodes to be physically very uncomfortable and honestly, highly distressing, like hand over heart, feeling like I'm going to die sort of vibes. I admit that's probably a bit dramatic and an overreaction, but my cardiac history and long road to a diagnosis has trained me to think this way. Additionally, I am dealing with Kaiser Permanente in California and unfortunately, they have a rather abysmal reputation for cardiology and electrophysiology is basically non-existent.I realize there's people out there that have PVCs and other palpitations and barely notice them, but for some reason when I experience them, its like I'm getting punched in the chest.My hope is that someone out there can give me a reason why I should NOT be worried about these events. My doctor seems to be very, very, unconcerned by them, and maybe he's right to think that, but an explanation would be nice and if there's a way to be less frightened by these episodes, I think that should be considered therapeutic and part of the plan for care in this situation.Thanks for reading.","So first things first I dont see clear P waves and you seem to be slightly irregular. Do you have a history of AFib? Secondly the beats that you point out are wide but also irregular. This makes it less likely that they are PVCs\/NSVT and more likely to be AFib with aberrant conduction if you have AFib to begin with. Since you have AVRT and have had ablation, its not unusual to have some aberrancy when the rate changes since you have an abnormal electrical conduction system thats also been burned. While this isnt life threatening in any way, increasing your bisoprolol dose would probably help keep the rates better controlled and decrease your symptoms. You can also get a cardioversion\/ablation if you are actually in AFib"
"I have what I think is a cyst under my left butt cheek it comes and goes and occasionally gets a tiny white head on it, it is very irritated and has a slight purplish color should I seek a doctor or could I take care of this myself because I don t have any medical care..","Welcome to Chat Doctor. 1. The most possible cause of a cyst / lump / lesion on the gluteal region / butt could be hair follicular infection.2. In case of follicle infection / inflammation there will be a cystic structure with collection within, which gives pain on touch and leak when you press the lesion.3. In this case you need to maintain local hygiene, with regular cleaning with antiseptic liquid to avoid the infections.4.

"Hi I went to urgent care today, haven t been feelin well. Extreme nausia, loose stools and headaches . A few months ago I had What I believed to be gallstones, the pain was severe but after an hour or two pain subsided so I never sought treatment, now I get dull pains upper right abdominal under rib, but not as painful as I had experienced before, I also had some blood in my stool for 2 days which has currently stopped. But I had a UA done about a month ago that came back with abnormal WBC when culture and sensitivity was done it came back negative. At urgent care today my Bloodwork came back fine but my UA showed 500 count leukocytes. I m going to have ct done of gallbladder . I am a 20 year old female , any idea what could be wrong","Hi young lady, you do have both gastrointestinal and urinary problems from the information provided. The CT scan will give us some information about how your kidneys and gallbladder look. Are you having any white discharge per vagina which is contaminating the urine? Infection of the urinary tract is the most common cause of pus cells in the urine. Repeat the culture. If repeated cultures are negative and there is no kidney stone on CT scan, you will need tests to look for causes of Sterile Syria. Blood in stools is not due to gallstones nor urine infection - it needs further assessment. Most commonly it is due to hemorrhoids (piles), but a doctor (surgeon/ GP) should examine you to confirm or negate this."

Pain to left side of my spine near my shoulder blade My partner is in pain and feels a vertebrate has popped out on the left side of his spine near his shoulder-blade. Are there any suggested advice someone can give me. I ve popped a vertebrate in his back before but the location is awkward near his shoulder blade and I can t pop back in the vertebrate.,"Hi, i would advise you not to indulge in any form of popping of the spine as it has delicate spinal cord and nerves around that area which may get damaged. If there is pain in the back near the spine it could be related to vertebral column or muscles in the region. Did your partner take any painkiller for the same? If the painkiller is not relieving him of pain and if it is more than 2-3 days then you should see an orthopedics doctor who would advise you to take a X-ray to rule out any bone problems and suggest treatment accordingly. If the pain is more you can try to take hot fomentation to they are it will soothe if it is muscular. Take care"

Your WBC count is slightly low. Normal ranges are from 4-11 thousand per cubic mm. Now what was the reason you visited the Healthcare facility? WBC commonly lowers in transient viral infections. Viral gastrointestinal infections could be a cause. However often the count rises to normal values few days after the infection has resolved. However, other causes of neutropenia are overwhelming bacterial infections, long term use of certain Chat Doctor.  In these cases the WBC count remains low for long periods of life. Better would be to get yourself tested again after 20-30 days. Most probably your transient neutropenia might have resolved by then.

Highly probable that I have Covid 19 and I was wondering if I should continue nursing my 12 month old daughter. She is also feverish but much milder than myself and I was curious if there is any literature or recommendations in regards to breastfeeding. I know other illnesses can pass on antibodies and wasnt sure if this was the same or if I could make her more sick.,"To my knowledge no evidence passed on breast milk.Illness generally very mild in children.QuestiomThank you for the information! This is indeed a pandemic of a lifetime, but i just wanted to clarify the overall death rate: 1 in 10 people are sick enough to get tested, of those 1 in 8 get hospitalized, of those 1 in 6 are critical and of those half die. So the death rate is 1\/10\/8\/6\/2 which is about 0.1% (probably understated a bit because some COVID deaths are misattributed). Is that correct or have I missed something? These numbers seem much lower than what usually gets reported (2% i believe).Data very rough, dont extrapolate from it.Mortality rate quoted for confirmed cases. Far more out there undiagnosed so probably lower than initially thought in the whole population. Mortality rate amongst elderly is horrific."

"my husband has been sick for 6 years with severe abdominal pain, which one specialist compared to heart attack like pain after witnessing the spasm and inflammation in his esophagus during an endoscopy, and severe nausea and vomiting. This has contributed to 100lb weight loss, he is 6 3 and weighs around 125-130 lbs. Recently he has started to regurgitate foam on a very regular basis. Sometimes it looks like dry spit and other times he says it tastes and feels like vomit. We are being treated by the va, but they basically told us they were no longer going to be doing diagnostic treatment, but now only symptomatic. We moved from SD to OR with the hopes that we would be able to find a doctor with more resources to finally get a diagnosis and proper treatment but the va limited us and now we don t know where to go or what to do. He suffers all day everyday. We have 4 young children and I have to call out of work frequently to take care of him. One of the the tests that the va did run was a gastric emptying which they said that his motility was 90% less than what it was supposed to be.

Your body needs time to heal and can suffer from the effects of an infection spreading. Did you take a prescription antibiotic since you had a prescription for pain medication?

The bottom of my stomach was hurting than it worked to the right side of my body. so when i lay down it hurt and so many prositions unless i lay on my back. Than it would go up to my shoulder making a sharp pain down to my chest . than it would move over to my chest. I thought i might been pregnant at first . but now i have bleedin from my vagainal area for like a month.,"Dear Miss, there are many conditions that can cause the symptoms that you described, but It seems to me like abdominal or gynecological ""story"". First, it would be helpful to know your age and your medical history. Pregnancy must be always excluded, but it can also be some kind of missed or early abortion that causes vaginal bleeding. Pain that you are describing seems like position-dependent pain, and it can be signed of serious abdominal infection (including pelvic infection) such as intra-abdominal or tuboovarian abscesses. The most common vaginal bleeding is benign, and it is called dysfunctional uterine bleeding, but without more information I cannot give you the right answer. I should know does it bleed after intercourse, during menstruation or all the time? Shoulder pain is usually referred pain from other place like abdominal cavity (for example abdominal infection as I've mentioned before) and also you can feel it associated with abdominal discomfort(especially when you're feeling bloated because bloated stomach makes pressure on Phoenix nerve).  My opinion is that there is high possibility that you suffer from endometriosis... So I advise you to do this: 1. Laboratory findings (red blood count to look for anemia, inflammatory markers to look for infection, urinalysis- reinfection, vaginal microbiology tests-STDs, estrogen, progesteron and steroid hormone levels) 2. Ultrasound-abdominal and Gynecological !- to search for intra-abdominal abscesses, tumors, cysts, endometiosis etc. 3. CT scan if needed Also you should obstinate till your symptoms disappear. Good luck."

"I put it in my post! Theres a lot of screenshots lol, so beware, but its every test result Ive received most recently (September 11th).","Is it just your arms that are blue? And the right started before the left?QYes, just my arms. The left one started turning blue before the right one, its the blood oddity that started in the right. My lips used to also occasionally turn blue months and months ago, but now its strictly my arms.Sorry it took so long to get back to you things have been crazy on my end with covid. Ive been thinking a lot about your case over the last few days. I think its really strange that its only your upper extremities that are changing color. Please keep an eye out for color changes on your legs or other body parts. Typically when there is some form of differential cyanosis (one part is blue and others arent) we think of cardiac defects and if its one specific limb poor perfusion. But given your age and normal echo a cardiac defect causing your symptoms is unlikely. My next best guess would be something like pernicious anemia\/B12 deficiency. This could explain your developing anemia and some of your pain symptoms. The blue coloring could be due to easy bruising related to it. However given that you have microcytic anemia (small red blood cells) and we typically see a macrocytic anemia (big red blood cells) with pernicious anemia\/B12 deficiency. But that doesnt necessarily rule out that as a cause for you symptoms. To evaluate this you would start by checking b12, folate levels. Like other have mentioned you could have a hemoglobinopathy causing the cyanosis and anemia which would be more consistent with your microcytosis. However I would have expected this to show up before now, have some known family history of anemia or bleeding disorders, and\/or have cyanosis or bruising on more of your body than just your arms. My best guess would be some kind of vasculitis causing vasospasm in your arms giving them a cyanotic appearance. The vasculitis could also be causing the pain you experience in your legs. Your developing microcytic anemia could be early anemia of chronic disease with maybe a pinch of iron deficiency thrown in. Id recommend asking for a ferritin and iron level to evaluate the anemia more. In terms of vasculitis workup, its a bit out of my wheelhouse so Id recommend considering seeing a rheumatologist for further evaluation. Those docs typically (or at least the ones I have worked with) are more of the safari guides than other docs and specialize in zebras.Tl;dr: Possibly a vasculitis, consider rheumatology. Also could be B12 deficiency\/pernicious anemia or hemoglobinopathy but less likely due to nerd stuff as above.*edit: Like to add that you should probably also consider seeing a hematologist as well if you havent."

Can she close her left eye? If she can not close her left eye, this would be indicative of Bells palsy, which is a benign condition. In such case the swelling could be caused by a local ear infection. Otherwise, I would recommend performing a CT scan to investigate for possible stroke. Hope I have answered your question.

"I started taking Lo Loestrin Fe 2 weeks ago, I have canker sores and tooth pain and pains all over my mouth and tongue could this be a reaction to my birth control pills. My dentist put me on ammoxicillin but this is not getting better. I thought it was a tooth but the pain is just getting worse thru my whole mouth.","Hello, Additional bleeding and some inflammation may be a response to your new medication. Overall sensitivity may accompany this reaction. For this I recommend warm saltwater rinses and continue practicing good oral hygiene. Keep well HY Chat Doctor.  Make your doctor aware of these symptoms. If improvement does not occur or the severity worsens, consider altering the medication. I place my patients on amoxicillin to help control infections usually related to an abscess from a single tooth. Amoxicillin can help control the spread of the infection which can give uncomfortable symptoms such as swelling, with pain. This will often occur near the site of the infected tooth for on the same side. What is the reason you were placed on amoxicillin? Do you have a respiratory, sinus, or ear infection? You may experience some throat and mouth discomfort with this condition while being treated. You may also experience a reaction to amoxicillin. This can be an allergic reaction or an oral yeast infection. Thrush may require an antifungal treatment to resolve your discomfort. Viral sores take time to heal and are also a possibility. I suggest taking some anti-inflammatory medication such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Ben"

"This makes a lot of sense to me, appreciate you answering. I agree and defer mostly to the hematologist.It becomes a challenging question when the labs that were ordered (myeloid NGS panel) are quoted at $1K+ and I have to decide if I want to follow through on that.","A good question to your hematologist is what she's going to do with a positive result. If there would be a treatment that would significantly reduce your risks and improve your life, the $1000 might be worth it. If she would just monitor your blood counts the testing might not be worthwhile. agree with the original physician response.Just wanted to comment on whether or not to do NGS for $1k. I think this is a little excessive if only for high Hgb. Id maybe try CALR mutation first. This is the second most common cause of high Hgb or platelets. Maybe do MPL. Also how are your platelets? And do you smoke by any chance or live at a high altitude?While PV can transition into a cancer, it is also easily controlled with things like hydroxyurea and therapeutic phlebotomy to keep your Hct down. Its not as scary as say full blown myeloid leukemia. Its something that is treatable.Just my 2 cents as someone who works in the field. Maybe bring these issues or questions up the next time you speak with your hematologist. I think the Pulm MD above also had a good thought about if any of these mutations come back positive, what does it do for your future monitoring and treatment?"

Since early highschool my energy levels have always been low, my body has generally felt quite sluggish. I always just attributed this to long school hours and work. My dad would joke, its like you got the hangover without the partyAbout 2 years ago I was done with school and really made an attempt to increase my health and energy to actually enjoy my days. For the next year or so I attempted to improve health through a consistent sleep schedule, diet, regular exercise, vitamins\/supplements, you name it, I tried it.

For the most part I was passed around with little to no results. I am self employed and this is the only reason I am still able to work, as my last episode had me bed ridden for nearly 5 weeks. I was prescribed Lidocaine, magic mouthwash, acyclovir, VitD3. None of these helpedFast forward to 2 weeks ago, and 6 doctors later, I now have $8,500 worth of blood work done.

Also, do you know if your CALR test was done by PCR and electrophoresis, or sequencing (i.e., next generation sequencing, NGS)?

As per the scan report you are having features of portal hypertension. I would advise you to get a Doppler scan of the portal venous system and an upper GI endoscopy done to confirm portal hypertension. This might be due to cirrhosis of liver.

Liver panel may be done which may show numbers indicating liver damage and chronic liver disease. Alcohol intake, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, Hepatitis B and C infection are some causes for chronic liver disease. You can consult a gastroenterologist for the above-mentioned tests.

He has the history of Hypertention, Diabetics for a decade also suffers from gastric ulcers. Some of our well wishers contemplating on going for KEELEYs method of treatment to avoid surgery. Can you please give details about this method and how far it is successful as an alternative to bypass surgery. Thank you very much. P. Srinivasulu / INDIA.","Hello thank you for posting here. I have gone through your description. Since he has two blocks in the heart arteries, and he is advice bypass, the right choice is to go ahead with bypass surgery. I don't know any therapy named KELLEY, but I suppose you are talking about ch elation therapy. This therapy is of no benefit for the patient. The blocks in the heart artery are embedded inside the heart vessel and any amount of medication or therapy cannot decrease it to make it vanish. Medications can only help to stop progression of the block. Definitive way to treat critical heart blockages is an angioplasty or bypass surgery. Had you been my patient my advice would be to go ahead with bypass? Bypass surgery requires a stay of 7- 10 days approx in the hospital. Patient can start walking usually by day 5 after surgery. It requires a recovery period of 20 -25 days, but the long term results of bypass are very good with patients having a good quality of life. Gastric ulcers can be treated with long term antacids. Gastric ulcers are not a contraindication for surgery. Wishing you good health thank you"

Does she feel breathless when she runs around or plays with other kids?4. Are the symptoms when there are seasonal changes?5. Is there any family history of asthma or any other sort of allergies like skin allergy etc.?6. Is the cough always associated with fever? If your answer is yes for any of the above questions, your kid might be having viral associated wheezing or multi triggered wheezing, and I suggest you meet a pediatric pulmonologist who is near your place.

hy dr plz tel me about my health my age is20 yrs and i was married in9august2010 i took medicine for concieving a baby after2months of my marriage first 2month dr gave me medicine but i was not pregnant then she gave me inj hmg massone this time again i was not pregnat in jan 2011 my husband went abroad and after that medicine i hve pain in lower abdomen i m so confuse why there is no pregnancy and pain if there are side effect of medicine and now what i have to do,"I think you are misguided about your complaint. There is no need of treatment for pregnancy in just 2 months of marriage. Also, you say that your husband went abroad, and you take treatment for pregnancy. Why? Primary thing is to live both of you together for at least 1 year. Your problem will solve without any treatment. If not than go to doctor. Please stop all the medicine you are taking. Hormonal in can give rise to pain in pelvic region."

A few more queries in my mind. Are tremors worst at rest of while you are doing something? Are they also affecting your right side?  Or if none at all on right side. Do you feel any heat or cold intolerance as compared to other people? one-sided tremors usually indicate start of Parkinsonism. If they are present only when you use your hand they are secondary to cerebellar problems. Have you experienced other features of Parkinsonism like slowness of your gait, difficult starting a walk, any rigidity in your muscles. And unbalanced posture ?so it's better to follow the neurologist advise of doing MRI and EEG. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take Disregards."

You have not mentioned which type of jaundice do you had in past?? You have taken antitb treatment which can lead hepatotoxicity and lead to hepatitis. So Chat Doctor. Just now viral cause for hepatitis has to be ruled to put by doing viral marker.Bag carrier can lead its elevated value. Fatty liver also can lead its elevated value.USG will be helpful for that.

Rightly as we see it is mastitis, but I am afraid the infection has not reduced yet during the treatment. It can be linked to shallow breastfeeding sometimes.

He spent a solid hour with us going over everything shes been experiencing the last six months with a fine tooth comb, reviewing prior records in the hospital system from the past year before the oxygen issue, and doing a thorough physical exam - we knew something crucial might be in those clues.Very long story short - its not a happy update but it unfortunately makes sense given a lot of other problems mom has been having during this same timeframe that just seemed insignificant or unimportant compared to the chronic respiratory failure. Things she thought could sit on the back burner til that was solved, but have been accelerating in just the past 2-ish weeks along with the worsening oxygen desats.Basically, there are several observable, objective signs and symptoms that seem to point to some kind of neurological\/neurodegenerative process\/disorder.He ordered a lot of tests that will be happening next week, and she will be seeing a neurologist for further evaluation on Tuesday.The more we read, the more huge lightbulbs are going off on this kind of process being a possibility. Not going to assume anything, and not trying to be negative, it is just undeniable that a lot of the puzzle pieces fit and we want to prepare for the worst mentally\/emotionally. It's a long way from here to final answers (if we ever get any, we are well aware we might not ever get this figured out, that there are limits to medicine), but I just thought Id update since my moms situation is such a very odd, even bizarre, case. Thanks so much to all of you who have pitched in.",Glad to hear you've found yourself a solid pulmonologist. Might I ask what institution he\/she is working at? I like to know where there are good folks if I ever need to reach out.

As a Urologist, i can understand your anxiety.You've two issues:1.fatty liver with high TGL and 2. Kidney stone-?uric acid.1. Its amazing that your TGL(triglycerides)reduced so much, without Chat Doctor.  Normally, a Statin with a Fenofibrate, is given to reduce the TGL. You need to do regular exercises and reduce fatty foods in your diet.2. You need to repeat your scan, to see if there are any other stones.  Furthermore, you should do a 24 hours urine uric acid, calcium. Your stone could recur.  "

My 27 year old son has a small lump and tenderness behind his nipple.  He has been treated for 10 days with flucloxicillin but still feels unwell.  The breast area is tender and there is slight tenderness under the armpit.  His symptoms generraly appear flu like. His doctor has said it may be a cyst which is infected.  He has now finished the antibiotics and is going back to see his GP early next week.  Do you have any advice.  Elaine,"Welcome to Chat Doctor .1. The history suggests that it can be infected cyst or an abscess or infective collection under the nipple.2. If the antibiotic course has not helped - then needs further evaluation.3. An ultrasound will be best to assess the pathology - it will help in analyzing the nature of the lump, its source and its extensions. At the same time axillary tenderness also can be assessed.4. Axillary tenderness will be probably musculoskeletal pain radiating or a lymph nodal enlargement due to localized infection. 5. In this case of infective collection the treatment of choice will be - small incision and Chat Doctor.  Good luck. Hope it helps you. Wish you a good health. Anything to ask ? Do not hesitate.

As you mentioned that, is it due to STD? Without V Chat Doctor. However, such type of itching may be due to, these possibilities, these include:1 Unhygienic care, since there are so many hairs, if proper care is not taken (poor hygiene) may develop itching, so wash this area with mild degree antiseptic solution or soap.2 Edematous dermatitis may be the next reason, diagnosis can be confirmed by physical examination.3 Lice may be the another reason, because this is the most prone area for development for lice. Wash this area with permethrin soap. In my opinion consult a dermatologist and get his opinion as physical examination is important. Good luck."
"Hello ,Dec. Of 2013 a 75 / 85 lb heater fell from the ceiling a 12 inch screw struck across my shoulder and the heater fell into my arm, I have a tear in my rotor cuff and nerves damaged in my arm and hand I ve been receiving therapy how long does nerves take to repair","Hi, thank-you for providing the brief history of you. It is sad to hear that a big object fell on your shoulder directly. I hope there are no burns to a greater extent. God bless us all. Coming to your query. You have damaged the rotator cuff muscles and the nerve as well. Now first thing we need a thorough deep neuromuscular assessment of the injured area. What is the status of the motor movements and also the sensation in the area and beneath it. To understand this better a Neuromuscular assessment will help to figure out the possibility of the regaining of the motor and sensory functions. Understanding that the healing of the nerve depends on the grade of the nerve injury. Also, by understanding the NCV test we can still estimate the possible causes and benefits to achieve by exercises. How is the rotator cuff status? Are you having a good mobility now, or it is stiff shoulder now? Without having a thorough assessment it will be a blind comment which is possible. Undergoing physical therapy will help improve the nerve by electrical stimulation and exercise. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor. "

Welcome and thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! Regarding your concern, I would explain that there are not many pharmacological treatments for postprandial hypotension. First, it is necessary to have the right diagnosis. How much does your blood pressure decrease after each meal? Does it decrease during standing up position too? I recommend consulting with your GP for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG, a head up tilt test (for orthostatic intolerance) and some blood lab tests : -complete blood count (for chronic anemia)-kidney and liver function tests-blood electrolytes-fasting glucose-glucose tolerance test (for possible glucose intolerance). You should closely monitor your blood pressure different times during the day and refer those values to your doctor. If the diagnosis of post radial hypotension is established, I would recommend some tips to help you improve this situation: - eat many small meals during the day and avoid large meals. - avoid fast absorbed sugar in food-avoid sugar and soda Chat Doctor.

"Hi, Doc. I think my knee is torn. I'm so sick that I can't carry my weight.","I'm sorry, because of the symptoms, it's good to run a radiation scan to confirm the diagnosis. Patient: What kind of radiation sequence is there?"
Exactly. Ive seen a couple cases like this. Id still recommend for OP to have her checked in the ED. Would rather not miss another explanation such as underlying infection and like others have mentioned possibly sepsis. Id suspect an infectious source will need to be ruled out first as it can then be treated with antibiotics and is more lethal. If nothing is identified from labs\/imaging maybe further pursue labs to rule out rheumatoid arthritis.,This sounds like it could be mono. It's possible she's septic from various sources but I'd think they would have been ruled out by the clinic you went to.Has she been getting worse or does it seem like she was bad at first and has stayed at that level?What does she doe for work?

I have pain in the lower portion of my right back extending to my right side a little bit. I did a urine test and there are no infections. I also do not recall doing any activity that could have caused a strained muscle. The pain is really bad when I lay down in bed and try to turn over.,"Hi, Thanks for your query and Welcome to Chat Doctor. I am Chat Doctor. You have mentioned pain in your lower back region with radiation of pain to the Right side, I guess your lower limb. Anyways since you are certain that there was no injury which could have actually caused a muscle strain etc., then we will have to work up in your case to actually rule out a fiscal prolapse or a degeneration etc. Before I can give you some advice I would like you to send me the following details:- What was the cause of onset of this pain if you can recall it?- Duration of the back pain and if present, your leg pain?- Apart from your back pain do you also have any associated numbness, weakness in limbs, paresthesia etc. as well?- Any aggravating or relieving factors of your symptoms?- How much distance can you walk, and what are your analgesic requirements on a daily basis?- What investigations and management has been done till now for your existing problems? I can tell you that lower back pain could be due to many reasons but at your age it is mainly postural and sometimes Fiscal in nature in which the Inter vertebral disc has lost height as a result of which there can be a mechanical back pain which is very discomforting for the patient. Rarely there can be a bony instability like pars defect or something which can lead to pain while doing work or activity involving movements at spine region. But the majority of these conditions actually can be managed conservatively with Posture maintenance, physical therapy and medications. Although I am sure you have tried a lot of medications and alternate form of treatments, but till the time I can see your details, If you have localized back pain with no other neurological symptoms like numbness, weakness, paresthesia etc., then you can start with following recommendations for initial period of 2-3 weeks:- To maintain proper posture of your back while working and sleeping, try maintaining an erect posture as much as possible- If pain is more than you can take a short course of an anti-inflammatory medications which suits you-Physical therapy initially under supervision of a trained physiotherapist, initially concentrating on SWD/IT or LASER therapy for back pain and TENS for your radiating leg pain-Adequate calcium & vitamin D intake if levels are low in body-Hot fomentation can be done at home 3-4 times in a day, if possible-Analgesic spray or ointment for local application can be used after fomentation- Avoid lifting heavyweight/ acute forward bending in mornings and take adequate precautions till pain completely subsides.etc will observe you for next 2-3 weeks how you respond to this conservative management protocol. If there is no clinical improvement, then we will plan for your investigations including blood tests, X-Rays and if your back pain is a long-standing one, then MRI of lower back region. Do not hesitate to contact me if you need any further assistance/SOS with more clinical details and test reportsThanks & Regards"

"Hi, I think I'm pregnant.","You have to do a standard pregnancy test first to make sure you're pregnant. Patient: OK, what else do you need to do?"
"Yes, my husband and I are trying to conceive. We conceived in 2008 & lost the baby at 14 weeks with a miscarriage. Since then, we have tried to get pregnant and learned April this year, I have premature ovarian failure with very little egg reserve left. Also, I just turned 40. All those factors are working against us.  Ive been on clomid for 3 cyles, and the last 2 months had mature follicles. Both times did not get pregnant. We decided to have my husband do a seamen analysis to see if things were ok in that area. He took 2 tests one month apart. There are 2 factors less than the desired level. My question is, could these 2 things be contributing to us not getting pregnant. His concentration was 6.2 out of desired 15 , and the motility was 33 out of desired 40.","Hallow Dear, At the age past 40, the fertility does go down; however, with proper monitoring and scientific approach, pregnancy is not impossible. Now let us start from the end of your query. Though a couple of parameters in your husbands' semen report are somewhat substandard, they do not rule out the possibility of conception. You may have to go for some assisted reproduction technology like intrauterine insemination of so. I am more concerned about your ovarian reserve. On what basis you have been declared a case of premature ovarian failure; and if so how is it that are responding to camphene citrate by ovulation? Anyway, your ovarian reserve seems to be very poor. Hence, I would advise you to monitor ovulation by ultrasonography. This will help to assess the endometrial growth also. Ovulation from the follicle between 18 mm to 21 mm gives best results. The endometrial thickness between 9 mm to 14 mm at the time of ovulation (thus indirectly conception and implantation) is very conducive for successful implantation and pregnancy. So at the time of ovulation with such conditions, you may get intrauterine insemination done to increase the possibility of pregnancy. You may try this for 3 months (considering your age and ovarian condition) after which you might seriously think of in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer. In this advice, I am presuming that you have tested the patency of your tubes, and they are patent. If you have not tested, please get Hysterosalpingography and/or Laparoscopy done for the tubal assessment before you take any active intervention step. I hope this clarifies your doubts. "

I gave you my best impression but this is not like anything Ive ever seen outside of textbooks, and I want to learn from this in case I ever have the chance to help a patient like your husband.QOut of curiosity, I am NAD, but could this be caused from an insect or spider? The reason I ask is I have friend who was bit by a spider while in Afghanistan and he still suffers complications from the wound site. While not near as extreme as what OPs husband is going through, but is it possible that OP is suffering from some sort of parasite or long term degeneration from venom? Would that turn up on any clinical tests? And do you think it would be prudent for OP to contact medical professionals in the country where OP was originally exposed?Has he had biposies of the lesions?QYes he has had biopsies several in fact alot of them come back as a burn but that's not the proble. This is not a burn.The fact that biopsy reports give the wrong answer and he's seen multiple specialists possibly suggests that you're dealing with a new, hitherto undocumented entity. What treatments has he had for this if any? Response to certain drugs could tell us what sort of disease process this is."
"Hello, I dont know what is wrong.   On Sept 11, 2014 I went to a clinic for what they said was just a cold. But they said something about high blood pressure and prescribed lisinopril. I had a follow up the next week and they said asthma. The Saturday after Christmas I went to another clinic they said pneumonia and prescribed a z-pak. I took it all and the cough seamed to be gone for 1 week then it was back.  I went back to the clinic and the prescribed a stronger antibiotic. I finished the 7 day and a week later my cough is not gone.  My insurance changed and my co-pay is too much.","Hello, Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history and would like to know more about you as follows: a. Your age & sex b. Did you have breathing difficulty for the first time or did you have such episodes in past? c. Do you have any known allergies, nose symptoms, etc.? d. What were all the symptoms during this episode? - nose congestion, fever, running nose, sneezing, cough, wheezing (whistling sounds from chest), breathing difficulty, etc.? e. Do you have any digestive complaints? f. Do you have any other medical conditions? g. Do you have to take any medicines on regular/frequent basis? h. What was the blood pressure when it was measured? What was your previous blood pressure? Above details would help me to know more about you and therefore to make more specific suggestions to you.2. At present, from your given history, it is not possible to decide whether it was an asthmatic episode or pneumonia, why you required antihypertensive Chat Doctor. 3. For patients with first time detected high blood pressure without evident reason, I usually ask them to get the blood pressure measured repeated at least twice in order to confirm that he/she is really hypertensive.4. To decide about asthma or pneumonia, more details are required as asked above.5. It is possible to have cough lasting for a few weeks after recovery from an infection, even after resolution of other symptoms such as fever, breathing difficulty, etc. For such cough, I usually suggest my patients regular warm saline gargles and avoidance of exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible. Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you. Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Wish you a quick recovery and the best of the health ahead.

"My 5 year old son is very healthy, we eat unprossessed foods, he plays outside alot. We live in the Tropics of Australia. He was diognaised with an innocent heart murmur at 2 years old. In the last few weeks he has been very tired, had pale stools & had dark rings under his eyes. He is a really good eater, having sugar free cereal each morning, snacks on fresh & dried fruit during the day & pasta, rice or meat & salad/vegies for dinner. He sleeps 11-12 hours each night. Am very concerned. Please help xoxo","Good Evening, Let me start by saying I am very sorry to hear about these symptoms your son is experiencing. Having said that, from personal experience these symptoms may or may not be separate from the heart murmur itself. Most diagnosed innocent heart murmurs are as their title suggests ""innocent."" They can and most will often go on throughout an individuals' life without causing any issue, except for that of a unique sound heard on physical exam. As for the symptoms you describe, these sound separate but nevertheless certainly more serious. Very tired, pale stools, dark rings? It sounds to me like a systemic illness that requires complete workup with at a Complete Blood Count and Basic Metabolic Panel. These will let us know if he has an infection, if his blood is healthy and strong and sufficient, if there are any electrolytes and or nutrients out of balance, and or if particular organs and or tissues in the body are ill. Based on his symptoms, and age, I must admit there are a variety of potential causes; Viruses and infections such as Mono or the Flu typically can cause gastrointestinal and generalized effects such as those you describe. Nonetheless, as it can indeed just be a virus, even more benign than the Flu or Mono, it can also be a completely different entity entirely, and thus a formal test really needs to be done to hone in on exactly what that is. My suggestion is to make sure your son HY Chat Doctor.  I would not rush him to the Emergency room unless a primary care physician could not be reached in an adequate period of time, or if your son starts to appear toxic and or the symptoms you are describing start to worsen. I truly hope for the best and believe you and your son will come out of this strong and well cared for. Warm Regards."

My father is a Liver cirrhosis patient.It is started 4 years back & it was minor.He used to go to doctor & do all the test.this time doctor said AFP is more(208)& increasing AFP is not good.Please suggest is it a dangerous situation.what&where the best treatment available.,"Hi, How are you? I am sorry to hear about your fathers' diagnosis of cirrhosis. AFP (alpha photo protein) is a substance normally produced by the fetal liver when it is in the uterus. Once the baby is born, the liver stops producing this substance so that in an adult the levels of AFP in the blood will be very low. Unfortunately, if there is a liver tumor growing, then this tumor starts to produce AFP and hence its level in the blood increases. So if there is a sudden increase in the blood levels of AFP, especially in a cirrhotic patient, it could potentially point to the development of a tumor in the liver. This needs to be evaluated with imaging studies, an ultrasound to start with, and then with a Tri-phasic contrast enhanced CT scan of the liver. The treatment options will depend on size and number of tumors and also the general condition of the patient. The best treatment for patients with cirrhosis and liver tumor is Liver transplant provided they meet some criteria. If the tumor is small, then percutaneous ablative techniques or even resection of a small segment of liver in which the tumor is located can also be done. Please do let me know where you are located, so I can guide you to the best center for treatment. Hope this helps and hope your dad feels better.

"I am a 50 year old male. Few months ago, I suddenly had pains around both hips and lower abdomen. I ve been walking on the treadmill, on average, 10 miles per week for many years and lately playing cricket (bowling fast like throwing fastball) with my kid. The pain became uncomfortable while driving and when turning sideways while sleeping. I realized quickly the pains had started after playing cricket with my belt tightened so that I did not have to worry about my pants dropping few inches every minute. I had played cricket the previous summer and had none of the symptoms listed above. But I always played wearing the belt a bit loosely. After about a month, the pains slowly went away completely. I continued playing cricket as well as walking on the treadmill. Last weekend, I forgot to loosen up the belt and played cricket for short time and the above listed pains came back right away. I feel the pains I am experiencing are muscular pains but worried that this might be a more serious condition than that, perhaps appendicitis etc. Appreciate any advice or suggestions. I checked for prostate cancer recently and was diagnosed negative. I also have the irritable bowel syndrome, cannot eat too much spices etc.","Hello, thanks for the query to Chat Doctor. C. Appendicitis ?  No way. Physically you are fit that's a nice thing. Pain around the buttocks and in pelvic region after belt you wore is somewhat tight. Now please do one thing that this pain may relate to large intestine (colon, rectum, anus ). Please get a U/S of whole abdomen to rule out any involvement of large intestinal parts. Lastly please consult a doctor for hemorrhoids and fissures as these two in early stage don't recognize easily. Have a good day. "

"Had dental  procedure six days  ago. I am resistant to  the local anesthetics and required quite a bit  more  ( 7 injections) to eliminate pain, was a little foggy  when I left there.  ( this resistance  is normal for me).  I had a perio  cleaning, a molar extraction, and a bone graft implanted.  The dentist closed with stitches.  Because I had  a perio  deep cleaning on the other side of my mouth and have an aortic valve  surgery scheduled in a month, I have been on amoxicillin for 2 weeks and just finished that today.  Note that I do not get headaches.  Ever.       After the extraction, I have not had pain or  problems with the wound itself , nor fever or sickness, however, I have had a mostly-pressure headache constantly for the entire week, and it does not seem to be lessening.  It is not sharp like a migraine must be, but I  also seem to have a  light-sensitivity going on as well as the tension-type headache.","Hello, Your surgery is still considered recent, and you are in an initial healing stage. It is not uncommon for you to experience some discomfort. Take anti-inflammatory medication and finish all medication as prescribed. Report your condition to your treating dentist. This is the best recommendation for evaluation post surgery. Upper extractions and surgery raise some concern if there is a sinus complication during the healing process. Do you experience any congestion in your sinus area?  This can explain a pressure headache. It is not unusual to experience a pressure sensation with a large amount of inflammation after multiple dental procedures. Again, anti-inflammatory medication may help you deal with this discomfort and your discomfort should continue to decrease with time. There is greater concern if you feel this condition is worsening. Thank you for your inquiry. Please schedule a follow-up visit with your dentist."

I suggest you not to worry much. You have not given your age here. Please understand that sex is not essential for human being. That is just another emotion where body and mind gets pleasure feeling rather than pain. Your frustration is understandable. You are denied of sexual pleasure, and then you are irritated. What happens if you desire sexual pleasure from someone you don't know? What happens if you don't get it from them? You are expecting your girlfriend to behave according to your wish and when she disagrees you are disappointed. What is wrong in that? How can you call yourself horny on that aspect? Masturbation once per day for teenagers and thrice or four times a week for adults are OK. Once you get married, your masturbation stops. When you get a job your masturbation reduces.

It probably is an acidity and reflux disease. Do you upper abdominal pain, nausea, burping, increase in pain on food, sour water feeling in throat or chest burning, if yes it further supports the diagnosis? You should avoid fatty, oily and high calorie diet. Have some walk after having food instead of taking rest. Have multiple small meals instead of heavy meals. Have regular sleep habits and avoid stress. Lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. Iron supplements tend to these symptoms, if having a lot you can take supplements after food. You can get prescribed tab Pan DSR 40 mg before breakfast once a day for 2 weeks.  If none of the above symptoms are present, then there is a possibility of cardiac arrhythmia like PSV or atrial fibrillation, in which heart rate suddenly goes up and also suddenly decreases. Blood pressure falls during these episodes and one has dizziness, fainting, blackouts, sometimes syncope. Usually ECG is normal as it is usually done in between the episodes. ECG done during episodes will show abnormality, so try to get ECG done during the episode. If ECG is not informative then you will need 24 hour holder monitoring if episodes are occurring on daily basis. So visit nearby cardiologist for this investigation. Till the time your evaluation is complete, you can ask your local doctor for tab collar LA 20 mg once a day."

Your symptoms are nonspecific and could be almost any kind of infection. A lot more tests might be needed. The first test you did for S. type only indicates you have been infected at some time; it may not be an acute infection. Some things I would consider are strep, pneumonia, malaria, other parasitic infections, HIV, herpes, certain other STDs, tuberculosis, atypical mycobacterial infections, other bacterial infections. Many bacterial infections require a different antibiotic than Ciprofloxacin. You need to have a good examination, to describe the rash, and get more testing done to see what this could be. Hope this helps."

Incomplete data like age, gender, any associated medical problem like diabetes, duration of antifungal (Terminating) treatment?? To be effective, Terminating should be taken for 6 to 12 weeks. The result of successful treatment will be seen until the nail grows back completely. It may take 4 months or longer to eliminate an infection. If you did not notice any response even after 4 months, it may be due to ineffective treatment or resistance to Terminating. In that case other medications like Itraconazole tablet or antifungal nail polish containing Ciclopirox would be more effective.

It is called Potts Disease which is the Infection of Spinal Vertebrae with the Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Bacteria which may be secondary to an extraspinal source of infection. It is a combination of osteomyelitis and arthritis that usually involves more than one vertebra. Get him examined by an Orthopedist so that he can examine him and rule out the exact cause by running few tests on him. Once confirmed he will be required to take anti TB medications for 3 months to 6 months to 1 year depending upon the severity of the infection. He has to complete the full course as there will be chances of relapse with much more severity causing neurological complications, which may require surgery then. He needs to go for regular follow up. Let him get adequate rest and eat healthy nutritious balanced diet which should include fresh fruits and green leafy vegetables. And avoid stress.

Do you have information about Cold and Cough Medicines,"Summary : Sneezing, sore throat, a stuffy nose, coughing -- everyone knows the symptoms of the common cold. It is probably the most common illness. In the course of a year, people in the United States suffer 1 billion colds.     What can you do for your cold or cough symptoms? Besides drinking plenty of fluids and getting plenty of rest, you may want to take medicines. There are lots of different cold and cough medicines, and they do different things.       - Nasal decongestants - unclog a stuffy nose    - Cough suppressants - quiet a cough    - Expectorants - loosen mucus so you can cough it up     - Antihistamines - stop runny noses and sneezing    - Pain relievers - ease fever, headaches, and minor aches and pains       Here are some other things to keep in mind about cold and cough medicines. Read labels, because many cold and cough medicines contain the same active ingredients. Taking too much of certain pain relievers can lead to serious injury. Do not give cough medicines to children under four, and don't give aspirin to children. Finally, antibiotics won't help a cold.    Food and Drug Administration"

i have been having an ache in my upper left back up by the scapula - it appears to be in the muscle because it is very tender to massage. the ache goes down back of my arm around to elbow it does not affect range of motion and does not hurt when doing activities it just aches sometimes more than others and i have been able to sleep fine should i use heat or ice on it also my neck is a little sore when i stretch it,Thanks for the query. Pain in scapular area and radiating along the arm usually indicate pinching of the nerve in cervical spine. Since how long you have this problem? If this is a long-standing problem then it needs to be investigated. Ice or heat application along with anti-inflammatory and muscle relaxants will help. Thanks.

Having a 28 grams prostate gland is expected for your age of 50. I would recommend doing a serum PSA to screen for prostate cancer. Otherwise, if you are generally happy with how you urinate? Do you have urinary frequency (urinating within 2 hours or less) ? Urinary urgency ? Waking up more than twice per night to urinate? Having a weak stream or urine? Having interrupted urination and straining during urination? These are symptoms of prostate problems or BPH and fairly common among men above age 50. If you have one or more of these symptoms I would suggest consulting with a urologist, so he can do a digital rectal examination (Chat Doctor. g. tamsulosin, treason ...) If your urination is okay, and you are not suffering from any of the above-mentioned urinary symptoms then your enlarged prostate is not causing any clinical consequence to you. We see patient with big prostates with no symptoms, and we also see some patients with relatively smaller prostates that are symptomatic.  I hope I have succeeded in providing the information you were looking for. Please feel free to write back to me for any further clarifications at: http://www.ChatDoctor .com/doctors/"

I just went to the dentist today assuming I had a cracked tooth; and I do not. He thinks I may clench my teeth. I don t know why this is happening now and never before. It lasts about 15 minutes","Hi, With your query, if your dentist said it is because of clenching teeth then you might be having attrition too along with the vague pain in the jaws and usually this happens whenever you clench your teeth or in the mornings if you have this habit in the night with slight discomfort in the TMJ. So kindly check for these signs and do you have any sensitivity?"
My daughter Anwesha is 10 yrs old. I am facing a problem of bed wetting with her. When she is sleeping she doesn t come to know about that she has done urine on the bed. This happens when ever she goes to sleep be it afternoon or night and almost every day. I am very much worried about her this condition. Please help me otherwise I will go mad because I am not able to have peace sleep plus very embracing in front of every body,"Hi, Does she have any other symptoms like frequency or urgency? Any history of inability to hold bladder when awake(urge incontinence)?  No such issues and physical examination is normal, I would have given a bladder stabilizing agent like desmopressin for 3 months.

"34F, 54, 125 lbs, nonsmoker, being treated for lymphoma and lupus, seeking oncology and rheumatology guidance for cohesive treatmentHello, I had to add all that info since the auto mod deleted me for not having all of it. Im about halfway through AAVD chemo for stage 4 Hodgkins and see a rheumatologist for lupus. I feel theres a disconnect between oncology and rheumatology in my treatment and Im not finding much online about rheumatology\/oncology, if that is indeed a field that exists. Im willing to travel a few hrs from NJ for treatment, just hoping theres a specialist who is knowledgeable in the treatment of both conditions since lupus, its treatment, and chemo put me at risk for more cancers. Looking forward to any suggestions anyone has. Thank you.","That field does not exist. The closest medicine gets is with multi disciplinary centers like Mayo or Cleveland Clinic where a bunch of different types of doctors collaborate on your case. I'm sorry you are going through this. Is there some reason why you think it would be best if they were the same person? Is something wrong with your current team? You said there is a disconnect but what does that mean? Perhaps if you talk with both providers, or their office staff, you can have your records synchronized between the offices so you don't feel that way?"
hi my name is juliaI have 2.5 yrs old boy he had temperature at 7pm 101.4f.  I gave him 4cc chilren tylenolthen I gave him another dose at 9.15pm 4cc his temperature droped to96.7f and last one at12 midnight and his temp now is 96.4 ist ok he had a case of ceasure at age 1,"You can safely use Tylenol in the prescribed dose 4-5 times a day for a child who is running fever. However, it seems that you are using it even when there is no fever. Stop using it by the clock, and use it only if there is fever above 99.5 degrees F. Why did the fever occur? Most likely a virus, but it is safer to go to his pediatrician in routine hours within a day if possible. Use sponging as a tool to reduce fever - as your child had a fit in the past, don't allow the fever to rise beyond 100 F. I hope that helps. Best wishes."

"34 female 5'9"" 230lbsNon drinker, light smoker but almost completely quit since the heart problems started. Had covid 6 weeks ago with no complications. No history of heart problems or high BP.It started less than 2 weeks ago with drops and spikes ranging from 90\/60 to 180\/110Now it's sustained high BP and elevated HR. I did go to the ER Monday just to make sure it wasn't something acute as there is accompanying chest pain but the entire time I was at the ER my BP was very low as was my HR.I have a cardiology appointment next Friday but every day since Monday I've been waking up with systolic in the 150s. I feel physically panicked all the time and it's starting to affect my sleep. I've already doubled my propranolol from 40 to 80, I take klonopin and prazosin daily as well, and I've added clonidine and antihistamines to also try to keep it lowered. Even taking all of those at once it barely makes a difference.I have a good life right now i can't think of any stressors other than being in love, but I feel like I can't do anything or be there for anyone because my body is fucking panicking 24-7 nowI can't do this much longer. It's obviously not an emergency but I feel awful not at all being in control of my body. It's like something flipped the fight or flight switch and it's stuck on high.

The stool was not hard but semi soft. no blood. no nausea. no mucus. no fever. just sore. There hasn t been any dietary changes.

"21 year old female with GI issues for years but they keep getting progressively worseI cant remember if I always had these issues, but I remember being 12 years old and starting to have very consistent diarrhea. All throughout middle school and high school I had mostly diarrhea BMs, with a few episodes of constipation. I always assumed it was how my family ate. Around 18 it got worse. I started to become constantly nauseous and lost over 50 pounds from throwing up and diarrhea. I went to the doctor but they told me change my diet. Since moving out last year and making changes to my diet to be healthier and adding more probiotics and fibers, nothing has changed and it feels like its getting worse. Now I have constant painful gas that bubbles in my stomach and honestly smells so bad. Im embarrassed to leave the house most days in fear my coworkers will notice. My joints have started to have unbearable pain, mostly in my hands and hips. I get sick once a month and it leaves me bedridden at least one day. I feel like my body is falling apart on me.I drink lots of water and try to keep my diet to standard to help my stomach, but Im not sure what else to do. I recently aged out of pediatrics and am unable to find any doctor near me that both accepts new patients and takes my insurance. I just feel so lostIve never had a diagnosis before other than for mental illnesses. Ive considered it being stress, and while it does get worse when Im stressed, its always like this no matter what my mental state is.For family history, we have no diagnosis of IBS or Crohns, but my mother had really bad undiagnosed stomach issues and died from breast cancer. All the women in my family have had breast cancer. My sister has diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis (she is 30, was diagnosed at 26)",Have you been tested for celiac disease? You should see a GI doctor if your PCP isn't doing any meaningful work-up. There are many possible causes

"(EDIT Below Original Post ) I kinda wrote all of this in a rush this morning after talking to his critical care doctor and surprised to see how many have responded, thank you again, It really means so much.I been staying with him for 99% of the time in the hospital. I went home for one day out of 35 days.He was having issues all of this year, mostly without not being able to eat. We went to ER early June and test results came back okay (or so we were told)He became really sick and malnourished so we took him to ER again in Sept and they performed a CAT Scan. They found a Mass.Biopsy of the Mass diagnosed it as Stage 4 Lung Cancer and now he's been in the hospital for over 5 weeks.He had a cardiac arrest which lead to him being put on life support but they carried on with doing radiation to treat the mass and shrink itHe has SVC Syndrome, Pleural effusion (chest tube) Gastrointestinal tube present (Possibly getting a G-J) , HCC Lung Cancer and AFIB ( Atrial Flutter)Medications: (TBE) He's been\/are onFor Pain: Morphine , fentanyl , Versed,Blood Thinners: Heparin, Zerelto, LovenoxBlood Pressures: Levophed, MidodrineDiuretics: Lasiks (oral)Lasiks (IV) 10mg to 20mg back to 10mg.Spironolactone (current)I really don't know what to do. They want us to tour LTAC facilities and we're scheduled to meet Palliative Care later on today..Chemo is an option but he might be too weak to do so..Idk if we should transfer hospitals to get second opinions or what.there isn't much I can do besides this. Being supportive and smiling.. Reaching out to people for help\/opinions...This feeling of uselessness is overwhelming..EDITED (Additional information): Thank you for all the replies and upvotes... It means a ton. He's responsive and understands what's going on. We're able to communicate with him and he does mouth out his concerns. Even tho he hasn't really had significant improvement, He hasn't been getting worse and has been maintaining stability and he's doing a lot better than when he was first admitted into the hospital. I've understood for a while that his cancer isn't curable from a medical standpoint and that it's only possible to maintain it through treatment. He's expressed that no matter how small the chance is, he wants to continue fighting. We've had this talk several times throughout the years. Even now he expresses this. Which is why I'm trying to explore every realm of possibility. They trached him and He's been on Spontaneous mode (his respirator) for almost a week, and they did take him off the vent for 2-4 hours a day to get him used to breathing on his own. His diaphragm is really weak and he gets really anxious whenever this happens because of how different it feels but his vitals and oxygen levels always seem okay. He says he isn't in any pain, he just gets frustrated & anxious at times but that's understandable. He's just fighting really hard, we all are. We have an amazing support system from friends and family and there's a lot of people rooting for him. I just want him to have a 2nd chance at life and be able to live whatever time he has left to the fullest. I have access to some of his records through MyChart but the daily notes that nurses and docs input isn't all there. I wish I had more information to provide you all. https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/rea1isQ.png","Sorry to hear.(HCC stands for hepatocellular carcinoma, a kind of liver cancer. It can metastasize to the lung, which can be a cause for confusion. Or perhaps he has a lung cancer and the acronym you were provided isnt quite right. Probably not of much consequence to the following discussion.)If there is talk of LTAC and he is on versed, I am guessing he is still requiring mechanical ventilation?One cannot be precise without seeing all the data but the typical prognosis with this general picture is very poor. If someone is ill enough to die while in the hospital while receiving optimal care, the odds of complete recovery after resuscitation are low (in the neighborhood of 10%). In those who go to LTAC on a chronic ventilator, only a minority ever come off the vent (~30%), and there is a high short-term mortality in these patients even when stage IV cancer isnt in the mix. Stage IV cancer of any kind, with very very rare exception (some testicular cancer, etc), is not curable.Meeting with palliative care seems like a very good next step. If they do not suggest it themselves, I would ask for a family meeting with the palliative care docs, ICU docs, oncology and radiation oncology docs all in the room together. This is often the best way to get a complete picture of the current medical issues.If he is not currently able to make decisions for himself, as I suspect from information provided he is not, the main question for you and your family is: what is the minimum quality of life he would accept? Some would say that unless current therapies have a good chance of returning them to independent living with intact cognition, they would not want to be maintained alive by machines or treatments. Some would say that if they can think but require complete assistance, that would be enough. Some would say even being maintained in a state in which they have no awareness of the outside world is acceptable.The main question for his doctors is: what are the chances his current treatments will get him to that minimum qualify of life, whatever it is for him? If the treatments and supports offered have little chance of returning him to a state he would find acceptable, then one could view his current therapies as prolonging a state of suffering.Sorry again for what your family is going through."

How are the lesions-itchy / fluid filled / pus filled? It was helpful if you can send us a picture. In hot and humid climate, most likely this is Emilia- small pimples over the skin due to clogging and blockage of sweat glands. In absence of secondary infection (painful / edematous / pus filled), this does not require any specific treatment other than avoiding direct sunlight and keeping the skin cool with wet moping 3-4 times a day(apart from routine bath). If itchy, I used to give calamine lotion and antihistamine like levocetirizine for few days. In short, if she is not febrile and the lesions are not with surrounding edema / pain / tenderness / pus filled-this does not indicate bacterial infection-hence no need of antibiotics and no chance of blood contamination.

i have a five and a half year old child i had an eptopic pregnancy about two years ago the baby dissolved into my tubes. i have been trying to get pregnant for the past seven months and it not happening. i did an untrasould and it came back with a normal study reading. What could possible be the problem.,"Hi, What is your age and BMI? Of the young couple trying for pregnancy about 80% of them conceive in a years time. So don't get stressed. To increase your chances of conception maintain normal BMI, quit smoking (if you're a smoker) and have intercourse at least three times in a week. Since you had an ectopic earlier there is a small possibility that the fallopian tubes may not be doing their job as they should be. If I were your doctor, I would wait for 4-5 months. If you don't conceive by then I would suggest a diagnostic laparoscopy. This helps to assess tubal patency and at the same time we can know whether the tubes are healthy. If there are any adhesions around the tube they can be released too. If you have any further concerns do contact me through Chat Doctor."

No one spoke of an abdominal ultrasound at all.He hasn't had a vomiting episode in a while, which I'm grateful for, but he is a very finicky eater. Often says he's not hungry or full, but I try not to stress because his weight and height have been increasing on the right trajectory and he's at the 70th percentile.The tone I perceive from doctors is that I'm overreacting because this is my ""baby"" and there's nothing wrong with him, but it's just such a stark contrast to his older brother.

I studied your query in full details updated from you. I understood your health concerns. Based on your query data, In my opinion, You seem to suffer from amenorrhea with incidental finding of ? Lump on abdomen, which seems to be fatty globular tissue of the abdomen, which felt like a ball. There is no connection of this Lump with the lower abdominal pain. It could mean due to lump in lower abdomen, if the size and depth of the lump indicates it as the lump coming from the abdomen and connected with lower abdominal pain.-In that case it could be TO(Tubo-ovarian) mass, or could buy Ovarian Cyst(Benign/ Malignant) or a Fibroid uterus, which needs to be ruled out by Second Opinion from Gone Surgeon and after USG abdomen and /Ct study of abdomen if need be. Thus Second opinion form Gyne-Surgeon and USG of the lump would resolve this issue. Hope this would resolve your query and worry. Welcome for any further query in this regard to ME.

"Sorry about that - hemoglobin was 126 g\/L exactly a year ago, 124 g\/L now.Happy to expand on the rest. I deal with near constant fatigue and hormonal issues like hair loss, hirsutism, abdominal pain, and digestive issues.","Awesome, thanks for posting. Unfortunately, your symptoms are not very specific for one thing. This means they can be explained by a lot of different conditions. That's what makes them so frustrating-- they're not obvious and that can sometimes get your team challenged. I think that's sometimes why young otherwise healthy women get told it's anxiety. I'm sorry in advance if that's happened. You mention hair loss, abdominal pain, and digestive issues. These together make me think about vitamin deficiencies and malabsorption syndromes. Hair loss alone can also be autoimmune in nature. You'd need to expand more on the GI issues for me to say something meaningful. I think all my recommendations are going to be low quality because I can't have a sit down session to discuss all your symptoms at length (eg what type of GI symptoms, any other autoimmune symptoms).Most vitamins are not on routine labs, and you need to test specific vitamin levels based on the disease you suspect is afoot (which is why we usually start with the history of the disease before we go to look at labs). Do you have any history of abnormal eating patterns, like eating disorders in your past (or present)? If so, that's where to start. If not, I think we might need to go down the route of testing for malabsorption. Fat in the stool (steatorrhea, you can google that, NSFW obvs) is usually a good clue for malabsorption to start with. There are some skin rashes that people get from certain malabsorptions as well, so it might be worth doing a skin check.As a random doc on a computer I'd probably send you to a GI doc to discuss your gi issues at length and evaluate for malabsorption. Even if we are sure that's the issue, though, there are still many conditions that can cause it. If it's not the issue (and again, sorry, these symptoms are not too specific so sometimes a lot of trial and error is involved) it may be worth discussing with a rheumatologist. Your primary doctor can also evaluate generally for rheumatic diseases.On the note of your primary doc, it sounds like you may not have a working relationship. I'm an advocate of switching docs until you find one who seems to be listening and has good open lines of communication with you.Iron itself is kinda a tricky one to get right. Bodies generally don't love iron (in fact we make a concerted effort to not absorb it). You could try taking your dose every 48 hours as one trick (when your body sees oral iron daily it gets more resistant to iron absorption). However, I don't know that is the answer for any of your issues, which is why I first suggested against looking at these labs too closely.Sorry to be long winded - internal medicine people usually are. As a first step, I'd go to a GI specialist to discuss these gi symptoms, stomach pain, and hair loss together as a possible malabsorption phenomenon."
I have some low back pain causing severe pain with ambulation and standing. I have had several epidurals and feel it it is time to get something done however I m very reserved about having any spinal surgery as I have seen over the years more hard done than good. Unfortunately here I am needing something done I m only 55 and was looking at neurosurgeons Dr .Gregory Nazar and Steven Reiss being new to Louisville I have no idea who has a successful surgery rate so I do have many questions. YYYY@YYYY,Still I would suggest that surgery on spine should be the last resort. Have you exhausted every other alternative. Have you exhausted Ayurveda's Agni karma treatment without invasion? Have you tried to manage by herbals or it's simply giving up? Pl. Do not give up. Hope is still there. Pl weight the pros and cons of spinal surgery. I would not allow my patients for this till other available channels are also exhausted. Hope it guides you even a bit !
"8 year old F, 4'1"" - Undiagnosed Condition \/ Continued dry cough - 2.5 years ongoingMedicines: Zyrtec (Switched from Claritin recently due to no positive response), Albuterol, Symbicort 160, pre+probiotic, antacid, - Has had adnoidectomy 2 months ago.My daughter has been going through an extremely long period of troubleshooting and we're still not at the end. What started out as a chronic cough and getting fevers and flu like symptoms were passed off as Covid towards the end of 2020.Then as the months went by it was passed off that she was getting sick at school. Various antibiotics and not getting better.Then in mid 2021 it was passed off as chronic sinusitus and told to use saline solution and more antibiotics.Then a few months later it was allergies and to take Claritin.Then after seeing the allergist it was Asthma because after 60pt test she's not allergic to anything but clearly decrease in breathing capacity so Albuterol.After seeing the cardiologist it was lower respiratory and take Symbicort with Claritin and Albuterol.After seeing ENT it was adnoids. After adnoidectomy she is to keep taking all of the above as well.Here we are two months later my daughter is home from school coughing just as she did two years ago. I have given her antacids and childrens pepto, along with pre+probiotics (largely because of the antibiotics) including all of the above mentioned medicine, and while she's no longer getting the flu-like symptoms she coughs so much she doesn't even realize she's doing it anymore. I don't know what's next. All ideas are welcome.",Have you seen a pulmonologist? Or was that wrapped in with the allergist?One consideration would be tic cough or somatic cough disorder which would require behavioral therapy.

Do you have information about Medical Ethics,"Summary : The field of ethics studies principles of right and wrong. There is hardly an area in medicine that doesn't have an ethical aspect. For example, there are ethical issues relating to        - End of life care: Should a patient receive nutrition? What about advance directives and resuscitation orders?    - Abortion: When does life begin? Is it ethical to terminate a pregnancy with a birth defect?    - Genetic and prenatal testing: What happens if you are a carrier of a defect? What if testing shows that your unborn baby has a defect?    - Birth control: Should it be available to minors?    - Is it ethical to harvest embryonic stem cells to treat diseases?    - Organ donation: Must a relative donate an organ to a sick relative?    - Your personal health information: who has access to your records?    - Patient rights: Do you have the right to refuse treatment?    - When you talk with your doctor, is it ethical for her to withhold information from you or your family?"

First, I would like to know more about you like - a. Since when do you have repeated cough? b. Have you had wheezing or breathing difficulty? If yes, how frequently? c. Do you have nose symptoms of allergy - nose obstruction, sneezing, running nose, etc.? d. Do you have headaches, facial heaviness, tickling in throat, etc.? e.

X-ray sinus is not the best investigation to diagnose sinusitis. CT scan of sinuses is considered a better investigation or sinusitis.4. I would also suggest you allergy testing for common air-borne allergens like house dust mites, indoor molds, regional pollen, insect proteins and pet dancers (if you have pet). This will help to know whether you have allergies, also to identify the substances causing symptoms to you as well as to know the measures to avoid them.5. At present, I would agree with your current treatment. Should you have wheezing of breathing difficulty, I would suggest you to use albuterol inhaler on an as-and-when-needed basis.6.

"Hello.I am 44 years old, and I am a seaman. Very often I was exposed to stressful situation, until about a year ago I had panic attack. I was feeling very scared when I was alone, thinking that I am going to die, I could not sleep in my bed because of some fear. If i have slept 2 hours I was awaking in panic and fear. Could not stay alone, could not concentrate on my job, constantly having bad thoughts passing through my mind. I have visited doctor who gave me Deanxit tablets, and after first one i felt amazingly better, only i had trouble sleeping. I was taking two tablets per day for about a month, than I signed off from the ship and stop with Deanxit. During vacation I have visited psychiatrist, explained what happened to me, and he told me that I have suffered panic attack. My psychiatrist has prescribed me SEROXAT - Paroxetin tablets, 20 mg, if happens againAfter two months at home, where everything was ok, only trouble sleeping from time to time, I have signed on another ship, and situation has started but not that strong as before.I have started taking Seroxat and everything was ok, only trouble sleeping again, and I have been taking Seroxat for full 4 months while I was on board the ship.Another two  months at home without tablets, but again trouble sleeping, and here I am on my present vessel, just signed on today.After talking with my family I am sensing and experiencing some kind of fear, now when I am alone in my room.Fear comes and goes, but I am still kind of afraid to go to sleep, even I am very tired.Thinking about taking Seroxat again or maybe Deanxit.Could you please tell me what to do and how and if is possible to treat this fear permanently.Thank you very much.","Degree understand your concerns went through your details.

"My daughter is presently eight years old and she was under foracort 100 inhalation since her fourth year. Presently, for the past six months, she is administered Budesonide (Budecort) 200 twice daily to control the wheezing . What are all the likely impact of these medicines on her general health and growth because of the continuous inhalation for the past 4-5 years. When these medication can be stopped.","Welcome to Chat Doctor. Steroid medications given by inhalers are usually safe, as there are less systemic side effects (side effects on other body systems). Both Forecourt and Decor are steroid medications. I would like to know:How has her control of Asthma/wheezing episodes? Has she been admitted in hospital? Is she getting any other asthma medications along with steroid inhalers? It is also important to continue monitoring her growth - weight and height whilst she is receiving steroids. Has there been any change in her growth profile over past 4-5 years? Steroids given in higher dosage or pretty long period of time (as in your case) can have impact. However, it is important to weigh the balance of these side effects vs controlling her asthmaInhaler medications can be stopped gradually provided her symptoms are well-controlled and regularly followed-up.

"My father died a sudden death due to bleeding from upper GI tract while on hemodialysis . He had a hemodialysis about 3 days earlier- then he had a bleeding episode- a hemorrhage and then he was admitted to critical care unit. He was kept on medicines and then one more dialysis was conducted on him just 2 days before he died. After this dialysis, he was kept in the CCU only for two more days. On the third day he had breathing problems. He was given oxygen through a mask. After about 15 hours, the docs said he has to be put into mechanical ventilation support. However, he did not survive in the ventilation. He died in about 1 and a half hours time. Could you please let me know if this death was timely or was it caused by some wrong medicines during his last dialysis.","Hi, Thanks for posting your query. Were your father was suffering from chronic kidney disease? Were there any defect in clotting time/ bleeding time/ prothrombin time? Had your father derangement of liver function test or any abdominal symptoms? Those patients who had already deranged liver and renal function may have deranged platelet function & prothrombin time with defect in coagulation. All these factors predisposes patient to bleeding with decreased clotting ability. Although heparin is given during dialysis but all these are applied by trained staff by measurement. So there is the least likely possibility of wrong medicines. You can also understand that when dialysis was not started, he got hemorrhagic episodes. So I think medicines are not the likely cause. Once bleeding is started, then a vicious cycle starts in body and if not controlled within time then It's very difficult to save life whether all medicines have been given by expert doctors. So doctors are also helpful at few places, and we have to accept the judgment of god. Thanks,"

Has your boy been evaluated for HLH (hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis)? ARDS is not a common manifestation of this, but considering the situation of runaway inflammation and that it is occurring in the context of CMV infection, this has to be considered. You can see inappropriate immune stimulation co-occurring with frequent infections and immune deficiency due to there being a milieu of overarching immune dysregulation. Texas Children's Hospital and Cincinnati Children's Hospital are particular specialists in treating these syndromes. I doubt that transfer of a patient on ECMO is possible, but those facilities may at least be able to provide some guidance."

"Hey yall My kiddo (3M, approx 42 pounds, 3.5 feet tall) (daily meds are nexium, senna, zyrtec, tenex, atarax, melatonin) got referred to hematology and I'm drawing a blank on what questions to ask. He had a blood smear that had ""abnormal lymphocytes"" and a high level of lymphocytes. He started seeing Immunology a few months ago because he's always had frequent infections and fevers just about daily for most of his life. Immunology doesn't have any diagnosis, but are thinking of referring him to rheumatology. Im just not really sure what questions to ask or what to say really. If there's a better sub for this, please point me in the right direction. Thanks y'all!","Where does it say ""abnormal lymphocytes""? That's unusual language. ""Atypical"" lymphocytes are seen with viral infections, classically mono. If the blood smear was the reason for referral, I would ask what the results mean. If the answer isn't clear, keep asking until you understand. They will tell you the differential diagnosis for the findings and what additional tests they recommend. There might be none.Frequent infections are the rule in childhood, not some weird immune deficiency. Is he really having fevers every single day for 3 years? Also, one of the most common findings with immune deficiencies is poor growth and your son is a tank :) Rheumatologic conditions in preschoolers often come with poor growth, rash, joint swelling, and very abnormal blood tests. But they can be more subtle and I can't say on the internet if that's a possibility in your case."

In the past couple of weeks I have noticed that it has become noticably enlarged on occasion (and visible from the surface) before reducing to its original size. It is pain less but I am not sure what it is and whether it needs to be checked.","Welcome to Chat Doctor .1. The most commonly seen in this area are lymph nodal mass - they are enlarged due to presence of underlying infections and inflammations. Anatomically it skin2. The second chance could be vascular dilatation (in competent venous channel)3. The possible chances are hernia (in terms of your explanation - no pain reduces on the size) little higher to the groin area.4. When you have the lumps, get an ultrasound lumps done - helps in identification of nature of lump, its origin and extensions. Hope it helps you. Wish you a good health. Anything to ask ? Do not hesitate. Thank you."

"Well, here's my week update. I am definitely continuing to feel better. I told myself that whatever seems to be happening to me is not something that I need to worry about. I am continuing to do my breathing\/meditation exercises 1-3 times a day. I am exercising daily (strength training, pushing the sled and riding the assault bike, usually 10 minute TABATA). I drink water with liquid IV daily, am eating well and sleeping well. I sauna every other day. My resting heart rate is still consistently elevated, about 100 - 110 standing. I used to be around the 70 range standing. I've only had one adrenaline surge in the last week. I do think that changing my state of mind has helped me avoid any extra stress but I do still feel like im not my usual energetic self. Like my body is working harder.","First of all,thats great to hear. In addition to that, a physical stress response, where your body constantly readies for fight or flight will sap energy from you. Are your palpitations still there?Your cardiology appointment isnt far now, that will hopefully help with stress, too, or maybe allow for more specific advice."

"Sudden loss of mobility - PCP refuses referral\/treatmentHello, I'm a 32(F) in the USA. African-American, 5'2"" and 144lbs. On Jan 3, 2022, I woke up around 2am with a terrible migraine. I had light sensitivity, confusion and extreme pressure behind right eye. Took excedrin but was unable to sleep due to pain. I was finally able to sleep about 45mins later as meds kicked in. Woke up the next day with a regular headache and soreness in right eye. On Jan. 5th, I suddenly became dizziness at work. The room began to rock and tilt causing loss of balance. My right ear felt clogged and I had pain in jaw joint on the right side. I was taken to ER and evaluated for heart attack, stroke etc. All tests came back normal. I remained in the hospital due to continued dizziness\/imbalance but all tests including MRI of head and neck were clear. Was given motion sickness meds but it didn't help. While in hospital, I started having pain in my right hip joint. The joint also pops\/clicks with movement. I've experienced the popping\/clicking since I was 14 years old (18 years and counting) but this is the first time there has been pain. The pain has spread across my lower back. The pain started as a stabbing, pinching pain and is now an achy and the best way I can describe it is bone deep.I also have weakness in my right leg and intermittent numbness. Two weeks ago, I began to experience multiple episodes of urinary and fecal incontinence. The hip and back pain has gotten worse and the dizziness is the same as when it started. Almost all blood test and urine test have come back normal except for my vitamin d levels. My vitamin d value is 10ng\/ml and I was prescribed over the counter vitamin d3 pills (1000unit)An MRI of my lumber spine was done (full report is linked). My PCP said it looked fine but didnt explain anything further. On the MRI it mentions the following:DISCS: L4-5 and L5-S1 disc desiccation and mild to moderate L5-S1 disc space narrowing.BONES: Slight chronic marrow signal changes. Body heights are generally maintained throughout.L3-L4: Slight posterior element degenerative change. Spinal canal and neural foramina are patent.L4-L5: Mild right eccentric disc bulge is slightly improved. Annular fissure. Slight posterior element degenerative changes. Spinal canal and neural foramina are essentially patent.L5-S1: Mild right eccentric disc bulge. Mild posterior element degenerative change. Spinal canal is patent. Slight predominantly bright neural foraminal encroachment.EXISTING MEDICAL ISSUESexercise induced asthma (I take Albuterol as needed)arnold chiari malformationthalassemia traitintermittent fatigueI've also had reoccurring migraines since I was 15 years old along with random, unexplained swelling of my hands and feet. Most recent flare up was unexplained very visible swelling of my left leg in July 2021. (Went to ER and tested negative for clots and gout)I suffer from random bouts of stomach inflammation that has been misdiagnosed as gallbladder disease (gall bladder was removed when I was 16) and has now been attributed to GERD. ( I take omeprazole for stomach and I have a history of stomach ulcers). Most recent flare was October 2021I've also had debilitating back pain since I was 15 years old and have completed physical therapy, acupuncture, multiple courses of steroid injections in my spine and at least 3 courses of prednisone. Pain has been caused by unexplained muscle spasms and bulging discs. I have these flare up at least twice a year.I sometimes have rashes that appear on my back and arms that are often misdiagnosed as ringworm (photos included). Fungal test always comes back negative. So far, the rashes have been diagnosed as eczema and rosacea. Flare ups occur approx once a year for the past 15 years. Rashes sometimes itch but its very mild. Most recent flare up occurred in November 2021.CURRENT SITUATION I requested a referral to be seen in rheumatology and at the spine clinic. PCP did blood test for rheumatoid arthritis plus urine test which came back normal and has refused my rheumatology referral request. PCP also will not refer to spine clinic and has instead enrolled me in a group physical therapy workshop.Dizziness has not changed in 2 months, pain is getting worse, muscle weakness is getting worse but I haven't been prescribed anything. I've been told to use ice and heat and to stretch.LIFESTYLE PRIOR TO CONDITION Before this began, I was very active. I practiced yoga once a week and took dance lessons twice a week. I'm also an avid hiker. I did not fall, over stretched or injure myself in any way prior to these issues. Due to the random flare ups of swollen legs and fingers, I also meal prep and am conscience of what I eat so I believe my diet is pretty good. I've always been an athletic. I played basketball, ran track and played tennis from first grade through high school. In college, I swam and took dance classes most semesters.I'm not used to being in this much pain and not being unable to move for this long. I feel like my PCP doesn't care. I don't know what's happening to my body and because my blood work looks normal, I'm being ignored. Please help! I just want my life back.","This is a rather complex history so I think it's difficult to give you any proper in-depth input. My main concern here is why you are being managed for this neurological condition by your PCP. Have you seen a neurologist for this? The reason I ask is that you're having multiple neurological symptoms with this sudden bout of headache and unilateral weakness and numbness that you have described. And MRI might be sufficient but a proper and thorough neurological exam is also needed. Unfortunately our current healthcare system does not allow for an in-depth neurological exam even in the neurologists office but at least it's worth a try.Agreed completely. Depending on the specifics of your history and exam, a total spine MRI, maybe slightly different types (sequences) of brain MRI, EMG, full neuropathy and rheumatologic panels may be warranted, as well as imaging of your hip.I will say, for what it's worth, that the fact that the numbness is intermittent is encouraging, and nothing on this lumbar MR report is dangerous or significantly abnormal (though it certainly could account for your back pain). Weakness in a single limb is typically a concerning thing to hear, however issues with the hip joint like you seem to be describing can cause weakness in the muscles surrounding the hip."
