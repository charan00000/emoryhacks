human,headache
ai,"Okay, I'm here to help. You're experiencing a headache. To understand what might be going on, can you tell me, **where is the headache located? Is it on one side of your head, both sides, or all over?**
"
human,all over
ai,"Okay, and it's all over your head. Thanks.

To get a better understanding of your headache, could you describe the pain? Is it throbbing, sharp, dull, or something else?
"
human,dull
ai,"Okay, it's all over your head and the pain is dull.

How long have you been experiencing this dull headache?
"
human,3 days
ai,"Okay, so you've had a dull headache all over your head for the past 3 days.

A headache that is all over and dull in nature and has been present for 3 days could indicate a tension headache, but it could also be related to other factors like stress, dehydration, or even eye strain.

Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the headache, such as neck stiffness, sensitivity to light or sound, nausea, or vision changes?
"
human,no
ai,"Okay, so you've had a dull headache all over your head for the past 3 days, and you haven't noticed any other symptoms.

Since it's been 3 days, have you tried any over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen? If so, did they provide any relief?
"
human,no
ai,"Okay, so you've had a dull headache all over your head for the past 3 days, you haven't noticed any other symptoms, and over-the-counter pain relievers haven't provided any relief.

Are you currently experiencing any stress or anxiety?

human,i am having chest pain
ai,"Okay, I understand you're having chest pain. I'm here to help gather some information so we can figure out what might be going on.

To start, can you describe the chest pain? Is it sharp, dull, crushing, or something else?
"
human,sharp
ai,"Okay, the pain is sharp. Can you tell me exactly where in your chest you feel the sharp pain? Is it on the left, right, center, or all over?
"
human,heart
ai,"Since you're indicating the sharp pain is related to your heart, can you describe how long the sharp pain lasts when you feel it?
"
human,consta
ai,"Given that the pain is sharp and located near your heart, and now you're saying it's constant, I want to rule out a few things. Does the pain radiate to your arm, shoulder, neck, or jaw? This could give us a better understanding of the potential cause. I am not a medical professional, and this is not a diagnosis, but constant sharp pain near the heart needs further investigation.
"
human,allat
ai,"I see. You mentioned ""allat."" Is that related to anything that might be triggering or worsening the constant, sharp pain in your chest?
"
human,all
ai,"Okay, I understand. The sharp pain near your heart is constant and radiates to your arm, shoulder, neck, and jaw.

Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the chest pain, such as shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, or dizziness? This information will help me get a better understanding of your situation.
