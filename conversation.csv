To gather more information, **on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being very mild and 10 being the worst pain you can imagine, how would you rate your headache?**

Since you feel the pain in the front of your head and it is constant, it could possibly be a tension headache.

To help me narrow down the possibilities, **have you noticed any stiffness or soreness in your neck or shoulders?**
