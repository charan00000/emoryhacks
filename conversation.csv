ai,"Okay, I understand. You're experiencing a throbbing pain in your temples.

To help me get a clearer picture, can you tell me about the intensity of the pain on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is mild and 10 is the worst pain you've ever experienced?

human,7
ai,"Okay, you're experiencing throbbing pain in your temples, and you rate the intensity as a 7. That sounds quite uncomfortable!

Given the throbbing nature and location, it could possibly be related to a tension headache or even a migraine, but it is too early to tell.

To help me narrow down the possibilities, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the headache, such as nausea, sensitivity to light or sound, or visual disturbances?
