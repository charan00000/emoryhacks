human,I have a headache
ai,"Okay, I understand you have a headache. To help me understand what might be causing it and how best to advise you, can you tell me, **where exactly does it hurt in your head?**
"
human,front
ai,"Okay, you mentioned the pain is in the front of your head. Can you describe the type of pain? Is it throbbing, sharp, a dull ache, or something else?
"
human,no
ai,"Okay, you said no. Does that mean the pain is not throbbing, sharp, or a dull ache? If not, can you describe the pain in more detail?
"
human,no
ai,"Okay, you said ""no"" again. I'm still trying to understand the type of pain you're experiencing in the front of your head. Since it's not throbbing, sharp, or a dull ache, can you describe it in your own words? For example, is it a pressure, a tightness, or something else?

Based on the location of your headache (front of the head) and that it's not throbbing, sharp, or a dull ache, it *could* potentially be related to tension or eye strain, but it's important to get a clearer picture of the sensation to narrow down the possibilities.
"
human,no
ai,"Okay, you've said ""no"" again. I understand you might not be able to easily describe the pain. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
"
human,no
ai,"Okay, you've indicated ""no"" again. Since we are having trouble describing the pain, let's try a different approach. Are you experiencing any other symptoms besides the headache in the front of your head, such as nausea, dizziness, or sensitivity to light or sound?

Given that the pain is in the front of your head and you haven't described it as throbbing, sharp, or a dull ache, and it's also not constant, it is even more difficult to narrow down potential causes. Knowing about other symptoms will help me understand what might be going on.
