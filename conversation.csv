ai,"Okay, I'm here to help. You're experiencing a headache. To understand what might be going on, can you tell me, **where is the headache located? Is it on one side of your head, both sides, or all over?**
"
human,all over
ai,"Okay, and it's all over your head. Thanks.

To get a better understanding of your headache, could you describe the pain? Is it throbbing, sharp, dull, or something else?
"

ai,"Okay, it's all over your head and the pain is dull.

How long have you been experiencing this dull headache?
"
human,3 days
ai,"Okay, so you've had a dull headache all over your head for the past 3 days.

A headache that is all over and dull in nature and has been present for 3 days could indicate a tension headache, but it could also be related to other factors like stress, dehydration, or even eye strain.

Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the headache, such as neck stiffness, sensitivity to light or sound, nausea, or vision changes?
"
human,no

Since it's been 3 days, have you tried any over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen? If so, did they provide any relief?
