human,I have a runny nose
ai,"Okay, I can help you with that.

To get a better understanding of your situation, could you tell me if you have any other symptoms besides a runny nose, such as congestion, sneezing, or a cough?
"
human,sneezing
ai,"Okay, thanks for letting me know you're also sneezing.

To help me narrow down the possibilities, how long have you been experiencing the runny nose and sneezing?
"
human,2 days
ai,"Thanks for letting me know. Have you noticed if your nasal discharge is clear, or is it colored (yellow, green, or any other color)?
"
human,reen
ai,"Okay, thanks for letting me know it's green. A green nasal discharge, along with a runny nose and sneezing, could indicate a possible infection, such as a cold or sinusitis.

To help me understand your situation better, have you experienced any facial pain or pressure?
"
human,no
ai,"Okay, thanks for letting me know you don't have any facial pain or pressure.

Have you taken any medication for your symptoms?
"
human,no
ai,"Okay, thanks for letting me know you have not taken any medication for your symptoms.

Since you have a green nasal discharge, runny nose, and sneezing for the past two days, and you're not experiencing any facial pain or pressure, it still could be a cold or another upper respiratory infection.

To gather a bit more information, have you had a fever or chills?
