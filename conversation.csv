ai,"Okay, you've had this dull headache in the back right of your head for about 2 hours, haven't taken any medication, aren't experiencing any other symptoms, and you were playing Valorant for 26 hours straight. Prolonged screen time and gaming can certainly contribute to headaches, potentially due to eye strain or muscle tension from posture.
