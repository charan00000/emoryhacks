            <p>human: headache</p>
<p>ai: Alright, I understand you're experiencing a headache. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, can you describe the location of your headache? Is it all over your head, on one side, or in a specific area like your forehead or temples?
</p>
<p>human: temples</p>
<p>ai: Okay, you're experiencing a headache specifically in your temples. When did this headache start?
</p>
<p>human: two days ago</p>
<p>ai: Okay, your headache in the temples started two days ago. Can you describe the nature of the pain? Is it throbbing, constant, sharp, or dull?
</p>
<p>human: constant</p>
<p>ai: Okay, you're experiencing a constant headache in your temples that started two days ago. Constant pain in the temples could be related to tension headaches, which are often described as a band tightening around the head. It can also be associated with other conditions, so further information is needed.

To help me narrow down the possibilities, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the headache, such as neck stiffness, sensitivity to light or sound, nausea, or visual disturbances?
</p>
<p>human: light sensitive</p>
<p>ai: Okay, you're experiencing a constant headache in your temples that started two days ago, and you're also experiencing light sensitivity. Light sensitivity (photophobia) along with a headache can be associated with migraines or tension headaches.

Have you taken any medication for the headache, and if so, what was it and did it provide any relief?
</p>
<p>human: no med</p>
<p>ai: Okay, you're experiencing a constant headache in your temples that started two days ago, accompanied by light sensitivity, and you haven't taken any medication for it.

Since the headache is in your temples, constant, and accompanied by light sensitivity, it is important to rule out other serious causes of headaches.

Have you experienced any fever, vision changes, weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking?
