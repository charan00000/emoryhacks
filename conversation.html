<p>ai: Okay, I understand. I'm here to help.

You mentioned you have a headache. To get a better understanding, can you describe the location of your headache? Is it all over, on one side, in your forehead, or somewhere else?
</p>
<p>human: forehad</p>
<p>ai: Okay. So the headache is located in your forehead.

Can you describe the quality of the headache? For example, is it throbbing, sharp, dull, or a pressure-like sensation?
</p>
<p>human: hrobbig</p>
<p>ai: Okay, I understand. So you're experiencing a throbbing headache in your forehead.

When did this throbbing headache start?
</p>
<p>human: two days ago</p>
<p>ai: Okay, I understand. You've had a throbbing headache in your forehead for the past two days.

Has the intensity of the throbbing headache remained constant, or has it been increasing or decreasing over these past two days?
</p>
<p>human: constant</p>
<p>ai: Okay, I understand. The throbbing headache in your forehead has been constant for the past two days.

Some possible causes of a constant throbbing headache in the forehead could include tension headaches, sinus infections, or even dehydration. However, it's important to gather more information to narrow down the possibilities.

Besides the throbbing pain, have you experienced any other symptoms such as nasal congestion, runny nose, facial pressure, or fever?
</p>
<p>human: congestion fever</p>
<p>ai: Okay, I understand. In addition to the throbbing headache in your forehead, you're also experiencing congestion and fever.

These symptoms, combined with the throbbing forehead headache, could potentially indicate a sinus infection (sinusitis). However, to get a clearer picture, have you taken any medication to alleviate these symptoms, and if so, what was it and did it provide any relief?
