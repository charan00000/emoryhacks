            <p>human: i have chest pain</p>
<p>ai: Okay, I understand you're experiencing chest pain. That can be quite concerning.

To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe the chest pain? For instance, **what does the pain feel like (e.g., sharp, dull, pressure, squeezing, burning)?**
</p>
<p>human: sharp pain</p>
<p>ai: Okay, you said the chest pain is sharp.

Can you tell me **where exactly in your chest you feel the sharp pain?**
</p>
<p>human: left side</p>
<p>ai: Okay, the sharp pain is on the left side of your chest.

Can you tell me, **does the pain radiate anywhere else, like your arm, neck, or back?**
</p>
<p>human: yes</p>
<p>ai: Okay, you mentioned the sharp pain on the left side of your chest radiates to another location.

To understand better, can you describe **where exactly does the pain radiate to?**

Based on your description of sharp pain on the left side of your chest that radiates, it's important to consider possibilities like musculoskeletal issues (such as strained muscles</p>
<p>human: to all those places</p>
<p>ai: Okay, you mentioned the sharp pain on the left side of your chest radiates to your arm, neck, and back.

To get a clearer picture, could you describe **how long the pain lasts when you experience it?**

Given that the sharp pain radiates to your arm, neck, and back, cardiac issues still need to be considered. However, it's also possible that this could be related to nerve compression or a musculoskeletal problem affecting multiple areas. It's important to gather more information to narrow down the possibilities.
</p>
<p>human: its been happening for a few minutes</p>
<p>ai: Okay, you said the sharp pain on the left side of your chest that radiates to your arm, neck, and back lasts for a few minutes.

To help me understand better, can you describe **what you were doing or what was happening right before the pain started?**

Given that the sharp pain radiates to your arm, neck, and back, and lasts for a few minutes, cardiac issues still need to be considered. Musculoskeletal problems and nerve compression could still be the cause as well. Gathering more information will help narrow down the possibilities.
</p>
<p>human: i was playing valorant</p>
<p>ai: Okay, I have gathered information about your chest pain.
