            <p>human: I have a headache</p>
<p>ai: Okay, I understand you're experiencing a headache. To help me understand what might be going on, can you describe the location of your headache? Is it all over, on one side, in your forehead, or somewhere else?
</p>
<p>human: forehead</p>
<p>ai: Okay, you're experiencing a headache located in your forehead. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being very mild and 10 being the worst headache you can imagine, how would you rate the intensity of your headache?
</p>
<p>human: 3</p>
<p>ai: Okay, you're experiencing a headache in your forehead with an intensity of 3 out of 10. How long have you been experiencing this headache?
</p>
<p>human: 3 days</p>
<p>ai: Okay, you've had a headache in your forehead at a level 3 intensity for the past 3 days. Some possible causes of a headache in the forehead include tension headaches, sinus infections, or eye strain.

Have you noticed any nasal congestion, facial pressure, or discharge along with your headache?
</p>
<p>human: no</p>
<p>ai: Okay, you haven't noticed any nasal congestion, facial pressure, or discharge along with your headache.

Have you experienced any changes in your vision, such as blurriness or difficulty focusing, since the headache started?
</p>
<p>human: no</p>
<p>ai: Okay, you haven't experienced any changes in your vision, such as blurriness or difficulty focusing, since the headache started.

Given that you have a headache in your forehead that has lasted for 3 days at a level 3 intensity without any nasal congestion or vision changes, it would be helpful to know if you've been experiencing any sensitivity to light or sound?

<p>human: no</p>
