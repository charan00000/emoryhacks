            <p>human: hello</p>
<p>ai: Okay, hello! I'm here to help. To get started, can you tell me what brings you in today? What are you experiencing?
</p>
<p>human: I have a headache</p>
<p>ai: Okay, I understand you're experiencing a headache. I can help you to identify the problem.

Can you describe the type of pain you're feeling? Is it throbbing, sharp, dull, or something else?
</p>
<p>human: throbbing pain in the temples</p>
<p>ai: Okay, I understand. You're experiencing a throbbing pain in your temples.

To help me get a clearer picture, can you tell me about the intensity of the pain on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is mild and 10 is the worst pain you've ever experienced?
</p>
<p>human: 7</p>
<p>ai: Okay, you're experiencing throbbing pain in your temples, and you rate the intensity as a 7. That sounds quite uncomfortable!

Given the throbbing nature and location, it could possibly be related to a tension headache or even a migraine, but it is too early to tell.

To help me narrow down the possibilities, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the headache, such as nausea, sensitivity to light or sound, or visual disturbances?
</p>
<p>human: sensitivity to ligth</p>
<p>ai: Okay, you're experiencing throbbing pain in your temples with an intensity of 7, and you're also experiencing sensitivity to light. This information continues to suggest a possible migraine, but other conditions are possible too.

To gather more information, have you noticed any changes in your vision, such as blurred vision, seeing spots or flashing lights, or any other visual disturbances alongside the sensitivity to light?
</p>
<p>human: blurred visdion</p>
<p>ai: Okay, you're experiencing throbbing pain in your temples with an intensity of 7, sensitivity to light, and blurred vision. These symptoms do point more strongly towards a migraine, though it's important to rule out other possibilities.

Has this happened to you before, and if so, how often do you experience these headaches?
</p>
<p>human: first time ever</p>
<p>ai: Okay, so this is the first time you've ever experienced these symptoms: throbbing pain in your temples with an intensity of 7, sensitivity to light, and blurred vision. This new information is helpful. As mentioned before, all of these symptoms point towards a migraine, but because this is the first time you are experiencing these symptoms it could be due to a number of other factors.

Have you recently experienced any significant stress or changes in your sleep schedule?
</p>
<p>human: cooked sleep schedule</p>
<p>ai: Okay, so this is the first time you've experienced a headache with throbbing pain in your temples (intensity of 7</p>
<p>human: no</p>
<p>ai: I have finished collecting information about your headache. Here's a summary of what you've told me:

*   **Symptom:** You're experiencing a headache with throbbing pain in your temples, rated a 7 in intensity.
*   **Associated Symptoms:** You also have sensitivity to light and blurred vision.
*   **History:** This is the first time you've experienced these symptoms.
*   **Potential Contributing Factors:** You have a "cooked" sleep schedule.
