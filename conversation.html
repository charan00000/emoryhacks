            <p>human: headache</p>
<p>ai: Alright, I understand you're experiencing a headache. To get a better understanding of what might be causing it, could you describe the location and type of pain you're feeling? For example, is it throbbing, sharp, dull, or a pressure-like sensation? And where is it located - is it all over your head, on one side, or in a specific area?
</p>
<p>human: dull</p>
<p>ai: Okay, you're experiencing a dull headache. How long have you been experiencing this headache?
</p>
<p>human: 2 days</p>
<p>ai: Okay, you've had a dull headache for 2 days. Have you taken any medication for it, and if so, what was it and did it provide any relief?
</p>
<p>human: no</p>
<p>ai: Okay, you've had a dull headache for 2 days and haven't taken any medication for it.

Since it's been a couple of days, I'm wondering if anything specific seems to trigger or worsen the headache? For instance, does it get worse with bright lights, noise, stress, or certain activities?
</p>
<p>human: no but I have a headache</p>
<p>ai: It sounds like you're still experiencing the dull headache, even though you said nothing triggers it. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the headache, such as nausea, dizziness, or vision changes?
</p>
<p>human: chills</p>
<p>ai: Okay, you're experiencing chills along with the dull headache you've had for the past two days. The combination of headache and chills could indicate a possible infection or illness.

Have you taken your temperature? If so, what was it?
