            <p>human: headache</p>
<p>ai: Alright, I understand you're experiencing a headache.

To help me understand what might be going on, can you tell me: **When did your headache start and how long has it been going on for?**
</p>
<p>human: 2 days</p>
<p>ai: Okay, your headache has been going on for 2 days. To help me understand your situation better, can you describe the type of pain you're experiencing? Is it throbbing, sharp, dull, or something else?
</p>
<p>human: dull</p>
<p>ai: Okay, so you're experiencing a dull headache that has lasted for 2 days. 

Can you tell me where on your head you feel the pain? Is it all over, or is it concentrated in one area, like your forehead, temples, or the back of your head?
</p>
<p>human: back</p>
<p>ai: Okay, so you're experiencing a dull headache in the back of your head that has lasted for 2 days.

Are there any other symptoms you're experiencing besides the headache, such as nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light or sound, neck stiffness, or vision changes?
</p>
<p>human: light sensitive</p>
<p>ai: Okay, so you're experiencing a dull headache in the back of your head that has lasted for 2 days, and you're also sensitive to light. This information is helpful.

Sensitivity to light along with a headache can sometimes be associated with certain types of headaches, like migraines or tension headaches. It could also potentially be related to other underlying issues, though less likely given the information so far.

Have you taken any medication for the headache, and if so, what was it and did it provide any relief?
</p>
<p>human: no</p>
<p>ai: Okay, so you're experiencing a dull headache in the back of your head that has lasted for 2 days, and you're also sensitive to light, and you have not taken any medication.

Have you experienced any recent stress or changes in your sleep schedule?
